exercise set 5.1*
write the first four terms of the sequences defined by the forumlas in 1 - 6
1. a-sub-k = k/10+k, for every integer k>= 1

starts at k >= 1
a1 = 1 / 11
a2 = 2 / 12
a3 = 3 / 13
a4 = 4 / 14

2. b-sub-j = 5 - j / 5 + j, for every integer j>=1
starts at j >= 1
b1 = 5 - 1 / 5 + 1 = 4 / 6
b2 = 5 - 2 / 5 + 2 = 3 / 7
b3 = 5 - 3 / 5 + 3 = 2 / 8
b4 = 5 - 4 / 5 + 4 = 1 / 9


3. c-sub-i = (-1)^i / 3^i, for every integer i>= 0
starts at i >= 0

c0 = (-1)^0 / 3^0 = 1 / 1 = 1
c1 = (-1)^1 / 3^1 = -1 / 3 = -1 / 3
c2 = (-1)^2 / 3^2 = 1 / 9 = 1 / 9
c3 = (-1)^3 / 3^3 = -1 / 27 = - 1 / 27


4. d-sub-m = 1 + (1/2)^m, for every integer m >= 0
starts at m>= m

d0 = 1 + (1/2)^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
d1 = 1 + (1/2)^1 = 1 + 1/2 = 1 1/2
d2 = 1 + (1/2)^2 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1 1/4
d3 = 1 + (1/2)^3 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/8 = 1 1/8

5. e-sub-n = floor(n/2) . 2 for every integer n >= 0
starts at n >= 0

e0 = floor(0/2) . 2 = 0
e1 = floor(1/2) . 2 = 0
e2 = floor(2/2) . 2 = 2
e3 = floor(3/2) . 2 = 2

6. f-sub-n =  floor(n/4) . 4 for every integer n>= 1

starts at n >= 1
f1 = floor(1/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f2 = floor(2/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f3 = floor(3/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f4 = floor(4/4) . 4 = 1 . 4 = 4

7. let a-sub-k = 2k + 1 and b-sub-k = (k-1)^3 + k + 2
for every integer k>=0. Show that the first three terms
of these sequences are identical but their forth terms differ


a0 = 2 . 0 + 1 = 1
b0 = (0 - 1)^3 + 0 + 2 = -1 + 0 + 2 = 1

a1 = 2 . 1 + 1 = 3
b1 = (1 - 1)^3 + 1 + 2 = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3

a2 = 2 . 2 + 1 = 5
b2 = (2 - 1)^3 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

a3 = 2 . 3 + 1 = 7
b3 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13
therefore the 4th term (a3 and b3) has different value

Compute the first fifteen terms of each of the sequences 
in 8 and 9, and describe the general behavior of these 
sequences in words. (a definition of logarithm is given in 
Section 7.1.)

8. g-sub-n = floor(log2 n) for every integer n>= 1
g1 = floor(log2 1) = 0
g2 = floor(log2 2) = 1
g3 = floor(log2 3) = 1.584... = 1
g4 = floor(log2 4) = 2
g5 = floor(log2 5) = 2.32... = 2
g6 = floor(log2 6) = 2.58... = 2
g7 = floor(log2 7) = 2
g8 = floor(log2 8) = 3
g9 = floor(log2 9) = 3
g10 = floor(log2 10) = 3
g11 = floor(log2 11) = 3
g12 = floor(log2 12) = 3
g13 = floor(log2 13) = 3
g14 = floor(log2 14) = 3
g15 = floor(log2 15) = 3

answer: explenation of the general behaviour of the sequences based on the first 15 terms:
it seems that the expression increments the number in a very slow growth rate
where the first term is 0
then the next 2 term is 1 (+ 1)
then the next 4 term is 2 (+ 1)
then the next 8 term is 3 (+ 1)

so whenever 2 reaches a new exponent it increases the number

9. h-sub-n = n . floor(log2 n) for every integer n >= 1
h1 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 0
h2 = 2 . floor(log2 2) = 2 . 1 = 2
h3 = 3 . floor(log2 3) = 3 . 1 = 3
h4 = 4 . floor(log2 4) = 4 . 2 = 8
h5 = 5 . floor(log2 5) = 5 . 2 = 10
h6 = 6 . floor(log2 6) = 6 . 2 = 12
h7 = 7 . floor(log2 7) = 7 . 2 = 14
h8 = 8 . floor(log2 8) = 8 . 3 = 24
h9 = 9 . floor(log2 9) = 9 . 3 = 27
h10 = 10 . floor(log2 10) = 10 . 3 = 30
h11 = 11 . floor(log2 11) = 11 . 3 = 33
h12 = 12 . floor(log2 12) = 12 . 3 = 36
h13 = 13 . floor(log2 13) = 13 . 3 = 39
h14 = 14 . floor(log2 14) = 14 . 3 = 42
h15 = 15 . floor(log2 15) = 15 . 3 = 45

answer: this is very similar to exercise 8, every addition to the exponent grows slowly
but this time you multiply it with the base

find explicit formulas for sequences of the form a1, a2, a3, ... with the initial terms given in  10 - 16

10. -1, 1, -1, 1, -1

a1 = (-1)^1
a2 = (-1)^2
a3 = (-1)^3
hence, the formula is the following
ak = (-1)^k for every integer k>=1


11. 0, 1, -2, 3, -4, 5

a1 = (-1)^1 . 0 = 0
a2 = (-1)^2 . 1 = 1
a3 = (-1)^3 . 2 = -2
a4 = (-1)^4 . 3 = 3

hence, the formula is the following
ak = (-1)^k . (k - 1)


12. 1/4, 2/9, 3/16, 4/25, 5/36, 6/49

a1 = 1/(1+1)^2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4
a2 = 2/(2+1)^2 = 2/3^2 = 2/9
a3 = 3/(3+1)^2 = 3/4^2 = 3/16
a4 = 4/(4+1)^2 = 4/5^2 = 4/25

hence, the formula is the following
ak = k/(k+1)^2


13. 1 - 1/2, 1/2-1/3, 1/3-1/4, 1/4-1/5, 1/5-1/6. 1/6 - 1/7

a1 = 1 - 1/2
a2 = 1/2 - 1/3
a3 = 1/3 - 1/4
a4 = 1/4 - 1/5

hence, the formula is the following
ak = 1/k - 1/k+1 


14. 1/3, 4/9, 9/27, 16/81, 25/243, 36/729

a1 = 1/3
a2 = 4/9
a3 = 9/27
a4 = 16/81

hence, the formula is the following
ak =  k^2 / 3^k

15. 0, -1/2, 2/3, -3/4, 4/5, -5/6, 6/7

a1 = 0^0 . 0 / 1
a2 = -1^1 . 1 / 2 = -1/2
a3 = -1^2 . 2 / 3 = 2/3
a4 = -1^3 . 3 / 4 = -3/4

hence, the formula is the following:
ak = (-1)^k-1 . (k-1)  / k

16. 3,6,12,24,48,96
r = 2
a1 = 3 (first term)
each step it seems to increase by 3 6 12 24 48

hence, the formula is the following:
ak = a1 . r


17. consider the sequence defined by a-sub-n = 2n + (-1)^n - 1
for every integer n>= 0. Find an alternative explicit formula for a that uses the floor notation.

a1 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 2 -1 -1 = 0 
a2 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 4 + 1 - 1 = 4
a3 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4

tranfsform each of 53 and 54 by making the change of variable i = k + 1
53. sigma(from k = 0 to 5 of k(k - 1))
answer:
first calculate lower and upper limits with the new summation
when k=0 -> i = k + 1 -> i = 1 
when k=5 -> i = k + 1 -> i = 6
thus the new sum goes from i=1 to i=6
next calculate the general term by replacing each occurence of k by an expression in i

since i = k + 1, then
k = i - 1
hence k(k-1) = i-1( (i-1) - 1)
therefore sigma(from k = 0 to 5 of k(k - 1)) transforms to sigma(from i=1 to 6 of i-1( (i-1) - 1))

54. pi(from k = 1 to n of k/k^2+4)
answer:
first calculate lower and upper limits with the new product
when k = 1 -> i = k+1 -> i = 2
when k = n -> i = k+1 -> i= n+1

thus the new product goes from i=2 to n+1
next calculate general term

since i = k+1, then
k = i - 1
hence k/k^2+4 = (i-1) / (i-1)^2 + 4
therefore pi(from k = 1 to n of k/k^2+4) transforms to pi(from i=2 to n+1 of (i-1) / (i-1)^2 + 4)


Transform each of 55 - 58 by making the change of variable j = i -1
55. sigma(from i = 1 to n+1 of (i-1)^2/i.n)
answer:
first calculate the lower and upper limits with the new sum
when i = 1 -> j = 1 - 1 = 0
when i = n+1 -> j = n + 1 - 1 = n

thus the new sum goes from  j = 0 to n
next calculate the general term

j = i - 1
i = j + 1
hence (i-1)^2 / i.n = (j+1-1)^2 / (j+1) . n
therefore sigma(from i = 1 to n+1 of (i-1)^2/i.n) transforms to sigma(from j = 0 to n of (j+1-1)^2 / (j+1) . n)

56. sigma(from i=3 to n of i/i+n-1)
answer: first calculate the lower and upper limites of the new sum

i = 3 -> j = 3 - 1 = 2
i = n -> j = n - 1

next calculate general term
j = i - 1
i = j + 1

hence i/i+n-1 = j+1/j+1 + n-1
therefore sigma(from i=3 to n of i/i+n-1) transforms to sigma(from j = 2 to n-1 of j+1/j+1 + n-1 )

57. sigma(from i=1 to to n-1 of i/(n-i)^2)
answer: first calculate the lower and upper limits of the new sum

i = 1 -> j = 1 - 1 = 0 
i = n-1 -> j = n - 1 - 1 = n - 2

next calculate the general term
general term i = j + 1 since j = i - 1
hence i/(n-i)^2 = j+1 / (n-j+1)^2

therefore sigma(from i=1 to to n-1 of i/(n-i)^2) transforms to sigma(from j = 0 to n-2 of j+1 / (n-j+1)^2 )

58. sigma(from i = n to 2n of n-i+1/n+1)
answer: first calculate the lower and upper limits of the new sum

i = n -> j = i - 1 = n - 1
i = 2n -> j = i - 1 = 2n - 1

next calculate the general term
i = j + 1 since j = i - 1
hence n-i+1/n+1 = n -(j+1)+1 / (j+1)+1

therefore sigma(from i = n to 2n of n-i+1/n+1) transforms to sigma(from i = n-1 to 2n-1 of n -(j+1)+1 / (j+1)+1 )

= (n+1)^2

69. n! / (n-k)!
answer: n . (n-1) . (n-2) ... (n-k+1) . (n-k)! / (n-k)!
= n . (n-1) . (n-2) ... (n - k+1)

70. n! / (n-k+1)!
= n . (n - 1) . (n - 2) ... (n - k + 2) . (n - k + 1)! / (n-k+1)!
= n . (n-1) . (n-2) ... (n - k + 2)

71. (5 choose 3)
= 5! / 3! (5 - 3)!
= 5! / 3! . 2!
= 5 . 4 . 3! / 3! . 2!
= 5 . 4 / 2!
= 20/2 = 10

72. (7 choose 4)
= 7! / 4! (7 - 4)!
= 7! / 4! . 3!
= 7 . 6 . 5 . 4! / 4! . 3!
= 7.6.5/3!
= 210/6 = 35

73. (3 choose 0)
= 3! / 0! (3-0)!
= 3! / 1 . 3!
= 3! / 3! = 1

74. (5 choose 5)

77.
a) prove that n! + 2 is divisible by 2 for every integer n >=  2

n = 2
n! + 2
2! + 2
2 . 1 + 2
4 -> divisible by 2

n = 3
3! + 2
3 . 2 . 1 + 2
8 + 2 = 10 -> divisible by 2

generalizatoin
since n>=2, number 2 is always included as a factor in n!
therefore it is alwas divisible by 2

= 2k! + 2
= 2 (k! + 1)

since it has the form of 2. some integer, therefore n! + 2 is even

b) prove that n! + k is divisibile by k for every integer n>=2 and k = 2,3,...,n

by the definition of factorial
n! = n . (n-1) . (n-2) ... 1
k is always a factor in n! since 2 <= k <= n
this means k | n!
or we can write it as n! = kd
(kd) + k
which has the form of k (some integer)
k is a factor of n! + k and therefore k | n! + k


c) given any integer m>=2, is it possible to find a sequence of m-1 consecutive positive integers none of which
is prime? explain your answer
I'm not sure about this,

78. Prove that for all nonnegative integers n and r with r + 1 <= n, (n choose r+1) = n-r/r+1 . (n choose r)

by the definition of binomial coefficient,
= (n choose r) = n! / r! (n-r)!

then we can apply these to both sides of the equation
n! / (r+1)! . (n-r+1)! = n - r / r + 1 . (n! / r! . (n-r)!)
lets focus on the right hand side
= (n - r / r + 1) . (n! / r! . (n-r)!)
= (n - r / r + 1) . (n! / r! . (n-r) . (n-r-1)!)
= n! / r + 1 . r! (n - r - 1)!
= n! / (r+1)! . (n-r-1)!

therefore the two sides are equal; it is proven

79. prove that  if p is a prime nmber and r is an integer with 0 < r < p, then (p choose r)
is divisible by p

answer:by the definition of binomial coefficient
n choose r = n! / r! (n-r)!

p choose r = p! / r! (p - r)!
therefore r!(p-r)! always divides p!
r! (p-r)! | p
rearrange p choose r
p! = (p choose r) . r! (p-r)!
p . (p-1)! = (p choose r) . r (p-r)!


80. suppose a[1], a[2], a[3], ... , a[m] is a one dimensional array and consider
the following algorithm segment

sum:= 0             ; initial sum = 0
for k:= 1 to m      ; start loop from index 1 to m
sum:= sum+a[k]      ; On each kth index, update sum to sum+a[k]
next k              ; go to the next k index

fill in the blanks below so each algorithm segment performs the same job
as the one shown in the exercise statement

a.
sum:= 0
for i:= 0 to m - 1 (since the 0 is counted)
sum:= sum+a[i+1]
next i

b. sum:= 0
for j:= 2 to m + 1
sum:= sum+a[j-1]
next j

use repeated division by 2 to convert (by hand)
the integers in 81 - 83 from base 10 to base 2

81. 90
90 / 2
= 45 -> reminder = 0 = r[0]
45 / 2
= 22 -> reminder = 1 = r[1]
22 / 2
= 11 -> reminder = 0 = r[2]
11 / 2
= 5 -> reminder = 1 = r[3]
5 / 2
= 2 -> reminder = 1 = r[4]
2 / 2
= 1 -> reminder = 0 = r[5]
1 / 2
= 0 -> reminder = 1 = r[6]

hence 90 = 1011010 base2

82. 98
98 / 2
= 49 -> reminder = 0 = r[0]
49 / 2
= 24 -> reminder = 1 = r[1]
24 / 2
= 12 -> reminder = 0 = r[2]
12 / 2
= 6 -> reminder = 0 = r[3]
6 / 2
= 3 -> reminder = 0 = r[4]
3 / 2
= 1 -> reminder = 1 = r[5]
1 / 2
= 0 -> reminder = 1 = r[6]

hence 98 = 1100010

83. 205
205 / 2
= 102 -> reminder = 1 = r[0]
102 / 2
= 51 -> reminder = 0 = r[1]
51 / 2
= 25 -> reminder = 1 = r[2]
25 / 2
= 12 -> reminder = 1 = r[3]
12 / 2
= 6 -> reminder = 0 = r[4]
6 / 2
= 3 -> reminder = 0 = r[5]
3 / 2
= 1 -> reminder = 1 = r[6]
1 / 2
= 0 -> reminder = 1 = r[7]

hence 205 = 11001101

87. write an informal description of algorithm
using repeated division by 16 to convert a nonnegative integer from decimal notation to hexadecmil notation (base 16

Input: a nonnegative integer a
Initialize: q := a, i := 0
While (i = 0 or q ≠ 0):
    r[i] := q mod 16        // remainder after division by 16
    q := q div 16          // integer division by 16
    i := i + 1

// Convert remainders 10 to 15 to hex digits A to F
For each r[j] in r:
    if r[j] = 10 then r[j] := 'A'
    else if r[j] = 11 then r[j] := 'B'
    else if r[j] = 12 then r[j] := 'C'
