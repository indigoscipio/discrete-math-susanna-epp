exercise set 5.1*
write the first four terms of the sequences defined by the forumlas in 1 - 6
1. a-sub-k = k/10+k, for every integer k>= 1

starts at k >= 1
a1 = 1 / 11
a2 = 2 / 12
a3 = 3 / 13
a4 = 4 / 14

2. b-sub-j = 5 - j / 5 + j, for every integer j>=1
starts at j >= 1
b1 = 5 - 1 / 5 + 1 = 4 / 6
b2 = 5 - 2 / 5 + 2 = 3 / 7
b3 = 5 - 3 / 5 + 3 = 2 / 8
b4 = 5 - 4 / 5 + 4 = 1 / 9


3. c-sub-i = (-1)^i / 3^i, for every integer i>= 0
starts at i >= 0

c0 = (-1)^0 / 3^0 = 1 / 1 = 1
c1 = (-1)^1 / 3^1 = -1 / 3 = -1 / 3
c2 = (-1)^2 / 3^2 = 1 / 9 = 1 / 9
c3 = (-1)^3 / 3^3 = -1 / 27 = - 1 / 27


4. d-sub-m = 1 + (1/2)^m, for every integer m >= 0
starts at m>= m

d0 = 1 + (1/2)^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
d1 = 1 + (1/2)^1 = 1 + 1/2 = 1 1/2
d2 = 1 + (1/2)^2 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1 1/4
d3 = 1 + (1/2)^3 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/8 = 1 1/8

5. e-sub-n = floor(n/2) . 2 for every integer n >= 0
starts at n >= 0

e0 = floor(0/2) . 2 = 0
e1 = floor(1/2) . 2 = 0
e2 = floor(2/2) . 2 = 2
e3 = floor(3/2) . 2 = 2

6. f-sub-n =  floor(n/4) . 4 for every integer n>= 1

starts at n >= 1
f1 = floor(1/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f2 = floor(2/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f3 = floor(3/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f4 = floor(4/4) . 4 = 1 . 4 = 4

7. let a-sub-k = 2k + 1 and b-sub-k = (k-1)^3 + k + 2
for every integer k>=0. Show that the first three terms
of these sequences are identical but their forth terms differ


a0 = 2 . 0 + 1 = 1
b0 = (0 - 1)^3 + 0 + 2 = -1 + 0 + 2 = 1

a1 = 2 . 1 + 1 = 3
b1 = (1 - 1)^3 + 1 + 2 = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3

a2 = 2 . 2 + 1 = 5
b2 = (2 - 1)^3 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

a3 = 2 . 3 + 1 = 7
b3 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13
therefore the 4th term (a3 and b3) has different value

Compute the first fifteen terms of each of the sequences 
in 8 and 9, and describe the general behavior of these 
sequences in words. (a definition of logarithm is given in 
Section 7.1.)

8. g-sub-n = floor(log2 n) for every integer n>= 1

9. h-sub-n = n . floor(log2 n) for every integer n >= 1

find explicit formulas for sequences of the form a1, a2, a3, ... with the initial terms given in  10 - 16

10. -1, 1, -1, 1, -1

11. 0, 1, -2, 3, -4, 5

12. 1/4, 2/9, 3/16, 4/25, 5/36, 6/49

13. 1 - 1/2, 1/2-1/3, 1/3-1/4, 1/4-1/5, 1/5-1/6. 1/6 - 1/7

15. 0, -1/2, 2/3, -3/4, 4/5, -5/6, 6/7

16. 3,6,12,24,48,96

17. consider the sequence defined by a-sub-n = 2n + (-1)^n - 1
for every integer n>= 0. Find an alternative explicit formula for a that uses the floor notation.
