Summation

Test yourself

1. the notation sigma(from k=m to n of a sub k) is read
answer: sigma/summation (from k=m to n of a sub k)

2. the expanded form of sigma(from k = m to n of a sub k) is
answer: am . a(m + 1) . a(m + 2) ... a (n)

3. the value of a1 + a2 + a3 + ... an when n = 2 is
answer: a1 + a2

4. the notation pi(from k = m to n of a sub k) is read
answer: pi/the product from(from k = m to n of a-sub-k)

5. if n is a positive integer, then n! = ____
answer: n . (n-1)!
or . n . (n - 1) ... 3 . 2 . 1


6. sigma(from k = m to n of a sub k) + c . sigma(from k = m to n of b sub k) = ___
answer: sigma(from k = m to n of (a sub k + cb sub k))

7. pi(from k = m to n of a sub k) . pi(from k = m to n of b sub k) = 
answer: pi(from k = m to n of (a-sub-k . b-sub-k )

exercise set 5.1*
write the first four terms of the sequences defined by the forumlas in 1 - 6
1. ak = k/10+k, for every integer k>= 1

starts at k >= 1
a1 = 1 / 11
a2 = 2 / 12
a3 = 3 / 13
a4 = 4 / 14

2. bj = 5 - j / 5 + j, for every integer j>=1
starts at j >= 1
b1 = 5 - 1 / 5 + 1 = 4 / 6
b2 = 5 - 2 / 5 + 2 = 3 / 7
b3 = 5 - 3 / 5 + 3 = 2 / 8
b4 = 5 - 4 / 5 + 4 = 1 / 9


3. ci = (-1)^i / 3^i, for every integer i>= 0
starts at i >= 0

c0 = (-1)^0 / 3^0 = 1 / 1 = 1
c1 = (-1)^1 / 3^1 = -1 / 3 = -1 / 3
c2 = (-1)^2 / 3^2 = 1 / 9 = 1 / 9
c3 = (-1)^3 / 3^3 = -1 / 27 = - 1 / 27


4. dm = 1 + (1/2)^m, for every integer m >= 0
starts at m>= m

d0 = 1 + (1/2)^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
d1 = 1 + (1/2)^1 = 1 + 1/2 = 1 1/2
d2 = 1 + (1/2)^2 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1 1/4
d3 = 1 + (1/2)^3 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/8 = 1 1/8

5. en = floor(n/2) . 2 for every integer n >= 0
starts at n >= 0

e0 = floor(n/2) . 2 = 
e1 = floor(n/2) . 2 = 
e2 = floor(n/2) . 2 = 
e3 = floor(n/2) . 2 =
