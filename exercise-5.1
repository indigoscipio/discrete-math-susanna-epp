exercise set 5.1*
write the first four terms of the sequences defined by the forumlas in 1 - 6
1. a-sub-k = k/10+k, for every integer k>= 1

starts at k >= 1
a1 = 1 / 11
a2 = 2 / 12
a3 = 3 / 13
a4 = 4 / 14

2. b-sub-j = 5 - j / 5 + j, for every integer j>=1
starts at j >= 1
b1 = 5 - 1 / 5 + 1 = 4 / 6
b2 = 5 - 2 / 5 + 2 = 3 / 7
b3 = 5 - 3 / 5 + 3 = 2 / 8
b4 = 5 - 4 / 5 + 4 = 1 / 9


3. c-sub-i = (-1)^i / 3^i, for every integer i>= 0
starts at i >= 0

c0 = (-1)^0 / 3^0 = 1 / 1 = 1
c1 = (-1)^1 / 3^1 = -1 / 3 = -1 / 3
c2 = (-1)^2 / 3^2 = 1 / 9 = 1 / 9
c3 = (-1)^3 / 3^3 = -1 / 27 = - 1 / 27


4. d-sub-m = 1 + (1/2)^m, for every integer m >= 0
starts at m>= m

d0 = 1 + (1/2)^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
d1 = 1 + (1/2)^1 = 1 + 1/2 = 1 1/2
d2 = 1 + (1/2)^2 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1 1/4
d3 = 1 + (1/2)^3 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/8 = 1 1/8

5. e-sub-n = floor(n/2) . 2 for every integer n >= 0
starts at n >= 0

e0 = floor(0/2) . 2 = 0
e1 = floor(1/2) . 2 = 0
e2 = floor(2/2) . 2 = 2
e3 = floor(3/2) . 2 = 2

6. f-sub-n =  floor(n/4) . 4 for every integer n>= 1

starts at n >= 1
f1 = floor(1/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f2 = floor(2/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f3 = floor(3/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f4 = floor(4/4) . 4 = 1 . 4 = 4

7. let a-sub-k = 2k + 1 and b-sub-k = (k-1)^3 + k + 2
for every integer k>=0. Show that the first three terms
of these sequences are identical but their forth terms differ


a0 = 2 . 0 + 1 = 1
b0 = (0 - 1)^3 + 0 + 2 = -1 + 0 + 2 = 1

a1 = 2 . 1 + 1 = 3
b1 = (1 - 1)^3 + 1 + 2 = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3

a2 = 2 . 2 + 1 = 5
b2 = (2 - 1)^3 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

a3 = 2 . 3 + 1 = 7
b3 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13
therefore the 4th term (a3 and b3) has different value

Compute the first fifteen terms of each of the sequences 
in 8 and 9, and describe the general behavior of these 
sequences in words. (a definition of logarithm is given in 
Section 7.1.)

8. g-sub-n = floor(log2 n) for every integer n>= 1
g1 = floor(log2 1) = 0
g2 = floor(log2 2) = 1
g3 = floor(log2 3) = 1.584... = 1
g4 = floor(log2 4) = 2
g5 = floor(log2 5) = 2.32... = 2
g6 = floor(log2 6) = 2.58... = 2
g7 = floor(log2 7) = 2
g8 = floor(log2 8) = 3
g9 = floor(log2 9) = 3
g10 = floor(log2 10) = 3
g11 = floor(log2 11) = 3
g12 = floor(log2 12) = 3
g13 = floor(log2 13) = 3
g14 = floor(log2 14) = 3
g15 = floor(log2 15) = 3

answer: explenation of the general behaviour of the sequences based on the first 15 terms:
it seems that the expression increments the number in a very slow growth rate
where the first term is 0
then the next 2 term is 1 (+ 1)
then the next 4 term is 2 (+ 1)
then the next 8 term is 3 (+ 1)

so whenever 2 reaches a new exponent it increases the number

9. h-sub-n = n . floor(log2 n) for every integer n >= 1
h1 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 0
h2 = 2 . floor(log2 2) = 2 . 1 = 2
h3 = 3 . floor(log2 3) = 3 . 1 = 3
h4 = 4 . floor(log2 4) = 4 . 2 = 8
h5 = 5 . floor(log2 5) = 5 . 2 = 10
h6 = 6 . floor(log2 6) = 6 . 2 = 12
h7 = 7 . floor(log2 7) = 7 . 2 = 14
h8 = 8 . floor(log2 8) = 8 . 3 = 24
h9 = 9 . floor(log2 9) = 9 . 3 = 27
h10 = 10 . floor(log2 10) = 10 . 3 = 30
h11 = 11 . floor(log2 11) = 11 . 3 = 33
h12 = 12 . floor(log2 12) = 12 . 3 = 36
h13 = 13 . floor(log2 13) = 13 . 3 = 39
h14 = 14 . floor(log2 14) = 14 . 3 = 42
h15 = 15 . floor(log2 15) = 15 . 3 = 45

answer: this is very similar to exercise 8, every addition to the exponent grows slowly
but this time you multiply it with the base

find explicit formulas for sequences of the form a1, a2, a3, ... with the initial terms given in  10 - 16

10. -1, 1, -1, 1, -1

a1 = (-1)^1
a2 = (-1)^2
a3 = (-1)^3
hence, the formula is the following
ak = (-1)^k for every integer k>=1


11. 0, 1, -2, 3, -4, 5

a1 = (-1)^1 . 0 = 0
a2 = (-1)^2 . 1 = 1
a3 = (-1)^3 . 2 = -2
a4 = (-1)^4 . 3 = 3

hence, the formula is the following
ak = (-1)^k . (k - 1)


12. 1/4, 2/9, 3/16, 4/25, 5/36, 6/49

a1 = 1/(1+1)^2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4
a2 = 2/(2+1)^2 = 2/3^2 = 2/9
a3 = 3/(3+1)^2 = 3/4^2 = 3/16
a4 = 4/(4+1)^2 = 4/5^2 = 4/25

hence, the formula is the following
ak = k/(k+1)^2


13. 1 - 1/2, 1/2-1/3, 1/3-1/4, 1/4-1/5, 1/5-1/6. 1/6 - 1/7

a1 = 1 - 1/2
a2 = 1/2 - 1/3
a3 = 1/3 - 1/4
a4 = 1/4 - 1/5

hence, the formula is the following
ak = 1/k - 1/k+1 


14. 1/3, 4/9, 9/27, 16/81, 25/243, 36/729

a1 = 1/3
a2 = 4/9
a3 = 9/27
a4 = 16/81

hence, the formula is the following
ak =  k^2 / 3^k

15. 0, -1/2, 2/3, -3/4, 4/5, -5/6, 6/7

a1 = 0^0 . 0 / 1
a2 = -1^1 . 1 / 2 = -1/2
a3 = -1^2 . 2 / 3 = 2/3
a4 = -1^3 . 3 / 4 = -3/4

hence, the formula is the following:
ak = (-1)^k-1 . (k-1)  / k

16. 3,6,12,24,48,96
r = 2
a1 = 3 (first term)
each step it seems to increase by 3 6 12 24 48

hence, the formula is the following:
ak = a1 . r


17. consider the sequence defined by a-sub-n = 2n + (-1)^n - 1
for every integer n>= 0. Find an alternative explicit formula for a that uses the floor notation.

a0 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0
a1 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 2 -1 -1 = 0 
a2 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 4 + 1 - 1 = 4
a3 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4
a4 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 8 + 1 - 1 = 8
a5 = 2n + (-1)^n - 1 = 10 - 1 - 1 = 8

sequence: 0,4,4,8,8,12,12...

ak = 4 . floor(k/2)
