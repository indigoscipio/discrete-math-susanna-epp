Summation

Test yourself

1. the notation sigma(from k=m to n of a sub k) is read
answer: sigma/summation (from k=m to n of a sub k)

2. the expanded form of sigma(from k = m to n of a sub k) is
answer: am . a(m + 1) . a(m + 2) ... a (n)

3. the value of a1 + a2 + a3 + ... an when n = 2 is
answer: a1 + a2

4. the notation pi(from k = m to n of a sub k) is read
answer: pi/the product from(from k = m to n of a-sub-k)

5. if n is a positive integer, then n! = ____
answer: n . (n-1)!
or . n . (n - 1) ... 3 . 2 . 1


6. sigma(from k = m to n of a sub k) + c . sigma(from k = m to n of b sub k) = ___
answer: sigma(from k = m to n of (a sub k + cb sub k))

7. pi(from k = m to n of a sub k) . pi(from k = m to n of b sub k) = 
answer: pi(from k = m to n of (a-sub-k . b-sub-k )
