exercise set 5.1*
write the first four terms of the sequences defined by the forumlas in 1 - 6
1. a-sub-k = k/10+k, for every integer k>= 1

starts at k >= 1
a1 = 1 / 11
a2 = 2 / 12
a3 = 3 / 13
a4 = 4 / 14

2. b-sub-j = 5 - j / 5 + j, for every integer j>=1
starts at j >= 1
b1 = 5 - 1 / 5 + 1 = 4 / 6
b2 = 5 - 2 / 5 + 2 = 3 / 7
b3 = 5 - 3 / 5 + 3 = 2 / 8
b4 = 5 - 4 / 5 + 4 = 1 / 9


3. c-sub-i = (-1)^i / 3^i, for every integer i>= 0
starts at i >= 0

c0 = (-1)^0 / 3^0 = 1 / 1 = 1
c1 = (-1)^1 / 3^1 = -1 / 3 = -1 / 3
c2 = (-1)^2 / 3^2 = 1 / 9 = 1 / 9
c3 = (-1)^3 / 3^3 = -1 / 27 = - 1 / 27


4. d-sub-m = 1 + (1/2)^m, for every integer m >= 0
starts at m>= m

d0 = 1 + (1/2)^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
d1 = 1 + (1/2)^1 = 1 + 1/2 = 1 1/2
d2 = 1 + (1/2)^2 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1 1/4
d3 = 1 + (1/2)^3 = 1 + (1/2 . 1/2 . 1/2) = 1 + 1/8 = 1 1/8

5. e-sub-n = floor(n/2) . 2 for every integer n >= 0
starts at n >= 0

e0 = floor(0/2) . 2 = 0
e1 = floor(1/2) . 2 = 0
e2 = floor(2/2) . 2 = 2
e3 = floor(3/2) . 2 = 2

6. f-sub-n =  floor(n/4) . 4 for every integer n>= 1

starts at n >= 1
f1 = floor(1/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f2 = floor(2/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f3 = floor(3/4) . 4 = 0 . 4 = 0
f4 = floor(4/4) . 4 = 1 . 4 = 4

7. let a-sub-k = 2k + 1 and b-sub-k = (k-1)^3 + k + 2
for every integer k>=0. Show that the first three terms
of these sequences are identical but their forth terms differ


a0 = 2 . 0 + 1 = 1
b0 = (0 - 1)^3 + 0 + 2 = -1 + 0 + 2 = 1

a1 = 2 . 1 + 1 = 3
b1 = (1 - 1)^3 + 1 + 2 = 0 + 1 + 2 = 3

a2 = 2 . 2 + 1 = 5
b2 = (2 - 1)^3 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

a3 = 2 . 3 + 1 = 7
b3 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 + 2 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13
therefore the 4th term (a3 and b3) has different value

Compute the first fifteen terms of each of the sequences 
in 8 and 9, and describe the general behavior of these 
sequences in words. (a definition of logarithm is given in 
Section 7.1.)

8. g-sub-n = floor(log2 n) for every integer n>= 1
g1 = floor(log2 1) = 0
g2 = floor(log2 2) = 1
g3 = floor(log2 3) = 1.584... = 1
g4 = floor(log2 4) = 2
g5 = floor(log2 5) = 2.32... = 2
g6 = floor(log2 6) = 2.58... = 2
g7 = floor(log2 7) = 2
g8 = floor(log2 8) = 3
g9 = floor(log2 9) = 3
g10 = floor(log2 10) = 3
g11 = floor(log2 11) = 3
g12 = floor(log2 12) = 3
g13 = floor(log2 13) = 3
g14 = floor(log2 14) = 3
g15 = floor(log2 15) = 3

answer: explenation of the general behaviour of the sequences based on the first 15 terms:
it seems that the expression increments the number in a very slow growth rate
where the first term is 0
then the next 2 term is 1 (+ 1)
then the next 4 term is 2 (+ 1)
then the next 8 term is 3 (+ 1)

so whenever 2 reaches a new exponent it increases the number

9. h-sub-n = n . floor(log2 n) for every integer n >= 1
h1 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h2 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h3 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h4 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h5 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h6 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h7 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h8 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h9 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h10 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h11 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h12 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h13 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h14 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
h15 = 1 . floor(log2 1) = 1 . 0 = 1
