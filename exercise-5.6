Exercise set 5.6
1. A recursive definition for a sequence cossits of a ___ and ___
answer: recurrence relation (recursive definition) and initial condition (base case)

2. a recurrence relation is an equation that defines each later term of a sequence by reference to
___ in the sequence
answer: its previous term

3. initial conditions for a recursive definition of a 
sequence consist of one or more of the ___ of the sequence
answer: values of the first few terms

4. to solve a problem recursively means to divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type as the tinitial suproblem
to suppose ___ and figure out how to use the supposition to
answer: the smaller problem is solved, solve the bigger initial problem

5. a crutial step for solving a problem recursively is to define a ___
in terms of which the recurrence erelation and initial conditions can be specified
answer: sequence

Exercise set 5.6
Find the first four terms of each of the recursively defined 
sequences in 1â€“8.

1. ak = 2a(k-1) + k for eveyr integer k>=2
a1 = 1
a2 = 2a1 + 2 = 2.1 + 2 = 4
a3 = 2a2 + 3 = 2.4 + 3 = 11
a4 = 2a3 + 4 = 2.11 + 4 = 26

2. bk = b(k-1) + 3k for every integer k>= 2
b1 = 1
b2 = b1 + 3k = 1 + 3.2 = 1 + 6 = 7
b3 = b2 + 3k = 7 + 3.3 = 7 + 9 = 16 
b4 = b3 + 3k = 16 + 3.4 = 16 + 12 = 28

3. ck = k(ck-1)^2 for every integer k>=1
c0 = 1
c1 = 1(c0)^2 = 1(1)^2 = 1
c2 = 2(c1)^2 = 2(1)^2 = 2
c3 = 3(c2)^2 = 3(2)^2 = 3.4 = 12

4. dk = k(dk-1)^2 for every integer k>= 1
d0 = 3
d1 = 1(d0)^2 = 1.(3)^2 = 1.9 = 9 
d2 = 2(d1)^2 = 2.(9)^2 = 2.81 = 162
d3 = 3(d2)^2 = 3.(162)^2 = 3. 78732 = 78732

5. sk = s(k-1) + 2s(k-2) for every integer k>=2
s0 = 1, s1 = 1
s2 = s(1) + 2 s(0) = 1 + 2.1 = 3
s3 = s(2) + 2 s(1) = 3 + 2.1 = 5
s4 = s(3) + 2 s(2) = 5 + 2.3 = 11

6. tk = t(k-1) + 2t(k-2) for every integer k>=2
t0 = -1
t1 = 2
t2 = t(1) + 2 t(0) = 2 + 2.-1 = 0
t3 = t(2) + 2 t(1) = 0 + 2 . 2 = 4
t4 = t(3) + 2 t(2) = 4 + 2 . 0 = 4

7. uk = ku(k-1) - u(k-2) for every integer k>=3
u1 = 1
u2 = 1
u3 = 3 u(2) - u(1) = 3 . 1 - 1 = 2
u4 = 4 u(3) - u(2) = 4 . 2 - 1 = 7

8. vk = v(k-1) + v(k-2) + 1 for every integer k>= 3
v1 = 1 
v2 = 3
v3 = v (2) + v(1) + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
v4 = v (3) + v(2) + 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9
