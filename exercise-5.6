Exercise set 5.6
Find the first four terms of each of the recursively defined 
sequences in 1–8.

1. ak = 2a(k-1) + k for eveyr integer k>=2
a1 = 1
a2 = 2a1 + 2 = 2.1 + 2 = 4
a3 = 2a2 + 3 = 2.4 + 3 = 11
a4 = 2a3 + 4 = 2.11 + 4 = 26

2. bk = b(k-1) + 3k for every integer k>= 2
b1 = 1
b2 = b1 + 3k = 1 + 3.2 = 1 + 6 = 7
b3 = b2 + 3k = 7 + 3.3 = 7 + 9 = 16 
b4 = b3 + 3k = 16 + 3.4 = 16 + 12 = 28

3. ck = k(ck-1)^2 for every integer k>=1
c0 = 1
c1 = 1(c0)^2 = 1(1)^2 = 1
c2 = 2(c1)^2 = 2(1)^2 = 2
c3 = 3(c2)^2 = 3(2)^2 = 3.4 = 12

4. dk = k(dk-1)^2 for every integer k>= 1
d0 = 3
d1 = 1(d0)^2 = 1.(3)^2 = 1.9 = 9 
d2 = 2(d1)^2 = 2.(9)^2 = 2.81 = 162
d3 = 3(d2)^2 = 3.(162)^2 = 3. 78732 = 78732

5. sk = s(k-1) + 2s(k-2) for every integer k>=2
s0 = 1, s1 = 1
s2 = s(1) + 2 s(0) = 1 + 2.1 = 3
s3 = s(2) + 2 s(1) = 3 + 2.1 = 5
s4 = s(3) + 2 s(2) = 5 + 2.3 = 11

6. tk = t(k-1) + 2t(k-2) for every integer k>=2
t0 = -1
t1 = 2
t2 = t(1) + 2 t(0) = 2 + 2.-1 = 0
t3 = t(2) + 2 t(1) = 0 + 2 . 2 = 4
t4 = t(3) + 2 t(2) = 4 + 2 . 0 = 4

7. uk = ku(k-1) - u(k-2) for every integer k>=3
u1 = 1
u2 = 1
u3 = 3 u(2) - u(1) = 3 . 1 - 1 = 2
u4 = 4 u(3) - u(2) = 4 . 2 - 1 = 7

8. vk = v(k-1) + v(k-2) + 1 for every integer k>= 3
v1 = 1 
v2 = 3
v3 = v (2) + v(1) + 1 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
v4 = v (3) + v(2) + 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

9. let a0, a1, a2,... be defined by the formula
an = 3n + 1 for every integer n>=0
show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation
ak = a(k-1) + 3 for every integer k>=1

we know that an = 3n + 1
a(k-1) = 3(k-1) + 1 = 3k-3 + 1
= 3k - 2

substitute into the recurrence relation
3k-2 + 3
= 3k + 1

this follows the structure an = 3n + 1 therefore it satisfies the sequence

10. let b0, b1, b2,... be defined by the formula
bn = 4^n for every integer n>=0
show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation
bk = 4 b(k-1)  for every integer k>=1

from the explicit formula we know that bn = 4^n for every integer n>= 0
we can use substitution

b(k-1) = 4^(k-1)

substitute into the recurrence relation
b(k-1) = 4 . 4^(k-1)
= 4^(k-1+1) by the rule of exponents
= 4^k
since the RHS of the recurrence relation simplifies to 4^k (equal to the explicit formula)
therefore it satisfies the sequence

11. let c0, c1, c2,... be defined by the formula
cn = 2^n - 1 for every integer n>=0
show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation
ck = 2 c(k-1) + 1  for every integer k>=1

from the explicit formual we know that cn = 2^n-1 for every integer n>=0
we can use substitution for k-1 for both

explicit formula
c(k-1) = 2^(k-1) - 1

recurrence relation
c(k-1) = 2 c(k-1) + 1
= 2 (2^(k-1) - 1) + 1
= 2.2^(k-1) -2 + 1
= 2.2^(k-1) - 1
= 2^(k-1+1) - 1
= 2^k - 1

therefore it follows the same structure as cn

12. let s0, s1, s2,... be defined by the formula
sn = (-1)^n / n! for every integer n>=0
show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation
sk = -s(k-1)/k  for every integer k>=1

s(k-1) = (-1)^k-1 / (k-1)!

substitute into recurrence relation
sk = -((-1)^k-1 / (k-1)!) / k
= -1^k / k!

therefore it satisfiesthe sequence 

13. let t0, t1, t2,... be defined by the formula
tn = 2 + n for every integer n>=0
show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation
tk = 2t(k-1) - t(k-2)  for every integer k>=2

substitute explicit formula with k-1 and k - 2
t(k-1) = 2 + k-1 = k + 1
t(k-2) = 2 + k-2 = k

substitute into recurrence relation
tk = 2.k + 1 - k
= 2k+2 - k
= k + 2 = 2 + k

therefore seqence satisfies.

14.let d0, d1, d2,... be defined by the formula
dn = 3^n - 2^n for every integer n>=0
show that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation
dk = 5d(k-1) - 6d(k-2) for every integer k>=2

substitute explicit formula with k-1 and k-2
d(k-1) = 3^(k-1) - 2^(k-1)
d(k-2) = 3^(k-2) - 2^(k-2)

substitute the recurrence relation
dk = 5d(k-1) - 6d(k-2)
= 5 . (3^(k-1) - 2^(k-1)) - 6 . (3^(k-2) - 2^(k-2))
= 3^k - 2^k

therefore sequence satisfites

15. for the sequence of catalan numbers defined in example 5.6.4, prove that for each integer n>=1
cn = 1/4n+2 (2n+2 choose n + 1)

from 5.6.4
explicit formula -> cn = 1/n+1 (2n choose n)
recurrence relation -> ck = 4k-2 / k+1 C(k-1)

prove the base case
substitute n = 0
c0 = 1 / 0 + 1 (0 choose 0)
= 1

prove the recurrnece relation
