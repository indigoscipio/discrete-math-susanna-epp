Exercise set 5.6
1. A recursive definition for a sequence cossits of a ___ and ___
answer: recurrence relation (recursive definition) and initial condition (base case)

2. a recurrence relation is an equation that defines each later term of a sequence by reference to
___ in the sequence
answer: its previous term

3. initial conditions for a recursive definition of a 
sequence consist of one or more of the ___ of the sequence
answer: values of the first few terms

4. to solve a problem recursively means to divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type as the tinitial suproblem
to suppose ___ and figure out how to use the supposition to
answer: the smaller problem is solved, solve the bigger initial problem

5. a crutial step for solving a problem recursively is to define a ___
in terms of which the recurrence erelation and initial conditions can be specified
answer: sequence

Exercise set 5.6
Find the first four terms of each of the recursively defined 
sequences in 1â€“8.

1. ak = 2a(k-1) + k for eveyr integer k>=2
a1 = 1
a2 = 2a1 + 2 = 2.1 + 2 = 4
a3 = 2a2 + 3 = 2.4 + 3 = 11
a4 = 2a3 + 4 = 2.11 + 4 = 26

2. bk = b(k-1) + 3k for every integer k>= 2
b1 = 1
b2 = b1 + 3k = 1 + 3.2 = 1 + 6 = 7
b3 = b2 + 3k = 7 + 3.3 = 7 + 9 = 16 
b4 = b3 + 3k =
