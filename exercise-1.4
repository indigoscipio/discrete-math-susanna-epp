1. a graph consis of two finite sets: VG and EG (vertex and edge sets)
where each edge is associated with a set consisting of vercies

2. a loop in a graph is a edge where it connects from a vertex to its vertex again/connected to itself
3. two distinct edges in a graph are parallel if, and only if, those edges have different relation/meaning
but still point from and to the same vertex

4. two vertices are called adjacent if, and only if they areconnected with the same edge/share same edge
5. an edge is an incident of two vertices or to itself
6. two edges incident on the same endpoint are I have no idea
7. a vertex on which no edges are incident is a empty/isoltaed vertex

8. in a directed graph, each edge is associated with possibilities/ possible states?

9. the degree of a vertex in a graph is the amount of edges tha points  to that vertex


exercise set 1.4
1. 
vertex set VG = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
edge set EG = {e1, e2, e3}

edge | endpoints
e1 = {v1, 2}
e2 = {v1, v3}
e3 = {v3, v3}

2. vertex set VG = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
edge set EG = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}

edge | endpoints
e1 = {v1,v2}
e2 = {v2, v3}
e3 = {v2, v3}
e4 = {v2, v4}
e5 = {v4}

3. graph G has vertex set {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} and an edge set {e1, e2, e3, e4}
with edge enpoint function as follows
edge | endpoint
e1 {v1, v2}
e2 {v1, v2}
e3 {v2, v3}
e4 {v2}

11. Find three other winning sequences of moves for 
the vegetarians and the cannibals in Example 1.4.7.

12. let goat = g, ferryman = f, cabbage = c, wolf = w, and boat =b
wolf cannot be together with goat
goat cannot be together with cabbage
starting state: gfcwB /
1st move - ferryman brings goat to right bank cw / fgB
2nd move - ferryman goes back to get the wolf: fcwB / g
3rd move - ferryman bring the wolf to right bank and picks the goat : c / gwfB
4rth move - ferryman picks the goat and back to the left bank : gcfB / w
5th move - ferryman brings cabbage to right bank: g / wcfB
6th move - ferryman brings the goat to the right bank / wcfbg

13. solve the vegetarian and cannlibals puzzle for case where there are 3 vegetarians and three cannibals
to be transported from one side of a river to the other - rule: v cannot be outnumbered by c

initial state: cccvvvB /
1st move: - bring 1c and 1v to the other side = ccvv / cvB
2snd mode: one cannibal went back and change boat seat to vv, transport them to the right bank = cccvvB  / v 
3rd move: 2vv arrives to right bank = ccc / vvvB
4th move: 1v gets back to pick 1c = cccvB / vv
5th move: 1v brings back 1c = cc / vvcB
6th move: repeat the same step again = ccvB / vvc
7th move: 1v brings back 1c = c / vvvccB
last move: 1v brings back 1c = / vvvcccB

14. Two jugs A and B have capacities of 3 quarts and 
5 quarts, respectively. Can you use the jugs to 
measure out exactly 1 quart of water, while obey
ing the following restrictions? You may fill either 
jug to capacity from a water tap; you may empty 
the contents of either jug into a drain; and you 
may pour water from either jug into the other.

initial state: A3q B5q
fill to capacity = F
empty all = E
pour = P
1st move: empty B = A3q B0q
2nd move: pour all A to B = A0q B3q
3rd move: fill A to capacity = A3q B3Q
4th move: pour A to B = A1q B5q
