1. a graph consis of two finite sets: VG and EG (vertex and edge sets)
where each edge is associated with a set consisting of vercies

2. a loop in a graph is a edge where it connects from a vertex to its vertex again/connected to itself
3. two distinct edges in a graph are parallel if, and only if, those edges have different relation/meaning
but still point from and to the same vertex

4. two vertices are called adjacent if, and only if they areconnected with the same edge/share same edge
5. an edge is an incident of two vertices or to itself
6. two edges incident on the same endpoint are I have no idea
7. a vertex on which no edges are incident is a empty/isoltaed vertex

8. in a directed graph, each edge is associated with possibilities/ possible states?

9. the degree of a vertex in a graph is the amount of edges tha points  to that vertex


exercise set 1.4
1. 
vertex set VG = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
edge set EG = {e1, e2, e3}

edge | endpoints
e1 = {v1, 2}
e2 = {v1, v3}
e3 = {v3, v3}

2. vertex set VG = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
edge set EG = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}

edge | endpoints
e1 = {v1,v2}
e2 = {v2, v3}
e3 = {v2, v3}
e4 = {v2, v4}
e5 = {v4}

3. graph G has vertex set {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} and an edge set {e1, e2, e3, e4}
with edge enpoint function as follows
edge | endpoint
e1 {v1, v2}
e2 {v1, v2}
e3 {v2, v3}
e4 {v2}
