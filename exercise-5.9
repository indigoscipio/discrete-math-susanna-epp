Test yourself
1. the base for a recursive definition of a set is ___
answer: a statement that the basic element belongs to a set

2. the recursion for a recursive definition of a set is ___
answer: a collection of rules stating how to build new sets from existing object in the set

3. the restrcition for a recursive definition of a set is __
answer: a statement that no object can belong to a set except those built from base case and recursion

4. one way to show that a given element is in a recursively defined set
is to start with an element or elements in the ___ and apply the rules from
the ___ until you obtain the given element
answer: base case, recursive case

5. To use structural induction to prove that every 
element in a recursively defined set S satisfies a 
certain property, you show that ___
and that, for each rule in the recursion, if ___  then ___
answer: the base case is true, the rule is applied for objects in the base case, the objects defined by the rule is also true

6.  A function is said to be defined recursively if, and 
only if ___
answer: its rule refers to itself

Exercise set 5.9
1. Consider the set of Boolean expressions defined in 
Example 5.9.1. Give derivations showing that each 
of the following is a Boolean expression over the 
English alphabet {a,b,c,...,x,y,z}

notes/from example 5.9.1:
~ = negation
V = OR
A = AND
I. Base: Each symbol of the alphabet is a Boolean expression.
II. Recursion: If P and Q are Boolean expressions, then the following are also Boolean expressions:
II(a) P A Q
II(b) P V Q
II(c) ~P
II(d) (P)
III. Restriction: There are no Boolean expressions over the alphabet other than those ob
tained from the base and the recursion.


a. ~p V (q A (r V ~s) )
answer: 
1. by I, the symbol p, q, r, and s is a boolean expression
2. by 1, II(c), ~p and ~s is a boolean expression
3. by 2, II(b), II(a), II(d) (r V ~s) is a boolean expression
4. by 3, II(d), II(a), (q A (r V ~s)) is a boolean expression
5. by 4, II(b), ~p V (q A (r V ~s)) is a boolean expression


b. (p v q) V ~((p A ~s) A r)
answer:


2. Consider the set C of parenthesis structures defined in Examples 5.9.2.
Give derivations showing that each of the following is in C.
a. ()(())
b. (())(())

3. let s be the set of all strings over a finite set A and let a,b, and c be any characters in A.
