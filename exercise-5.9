3. let S be the set of all strings over a finite set A and let a,b, and c be any characters in A.
a. using theorem 5.9.1 but not theorem 5.9.3 or 5.9.4, show that (ab)c = a(bc)
note from theorem 5.9.1
Theorem 5.9.1  Characters Are Strings
If A is a finite set and S is the set of all strings over A, then every character in A is a string in S.
proof:
(1) Suppose c is any character in A.
(2) By part I of the definition of string, (lambda) is a string in S.
(3) By part II(a) of the definition of string, (lambda)c is a string in S.
(4) By part I of the definition of string, (lambda)c = c.
(5) Thus c is a string in S.

answer:
let a,b, and c be any characters in A.
we need to show that (ab)c = a(bc)
1. since a,b,and c are characters in A, therefore each of them is a string in S
2. since a and b are strings in s, then we can concatenate ab. So ab is in S
3. since ab is a string and c is a string, (ab)c is in S
4. likewise, since a is a string and bc is a string, a(bc) is in s
5. since both (ab)c and a(bc) represent the same sequence and string they must be equal


b. show that ab is a string in S. then us the result of part (a) to conclude that a(bc) is a string in S.
(this exercise shows that parentheses are not needed when writing the string abc)
answer:
1. since a,b,and c are characters in S, each of them is a string in S
2. since a and b are strings in s then we can concatenate it inti ab , so ab is in S
3. since ab is a string and c is a chracter, we can concatenate it into (ab)c, so (ab)c is in S
4. from the result of a, we know that (ab)c = a(bc)
5. therefore since (ab)c is a string we can conclude a(bc) is also in s

4. consider the MIU-system discussed in example 5.9.4. give derivations showing that each of the following is in the MIU system.
example 5.9.4
I. Base: M I is in the M I U-system.
 II. Recursion:
II(a)  If x I is in the M I U-system, where x is a string, then x I U is in the M I U-system. 
(In other words, you can add a U to any string that ends in I. For example, since 
M I is in the system, so is M I U.)
II(b)  If M x is in the M I U-system, where x is a string, then M x x is in the M I U-system. 
(In other words, you can repeat all the characters in a string that follow an initial 
M. For example, if M U I is in the system, so is M U I U I.)
II(c)  If x I I I y is in the M I U-system, where x and y are strings (possibly null), then x 
U y is also in the M I U-system. (In other words, you can replace I I I by U. For 
example, if M I I I I is in the system, so are M I U and M U I.)
II(d)  If x U U y is in the M I U-system, where x and y are strings (possibly null), then  
x U y is also in the M I U-system. (In other words, you can replace U U by U. For 
example, if M I I U U is in the system, so is M I I U.)

a. M I U I
answer:
1. start with M I since its the base case
2. by rule IIc, we can repeat it into M I I
3. by rule IIc, we can repeat it into M I I I I 
3. by rule IIc, we can repeat it into M I I I I I I I I


b. M U I I U
answer:
1. start with M I since it's the base case
2. by rule 2c, we can repeat the I into M I I
3. by rule 2c, we can repeat the I in to M I I I I
4. by rule 2c, we can repeat the I into M I I I I I I I I
5. by rule 2b, turn the first triple I into U = M U I I I I I
6. by rule 2b, turn the last triple I into U =  M U I I U

5. the set of arithmetic expression over the real numbers can be defined recursively as follows:
I. base : each real number r is an arithmetic expression
II. recursion: if u and v are arithmetic expr, then the following are also arithmetic expr
IIa. (+u)
IIb. (-u)
IIc. (u + v)
IId. (u - v)
IIe. (u * v)
IIf. (u / v)
III. restriction: there are no arithmetic expr over the real nombers other than those obtaind from I and II
note that the artihemtic expr u/v is allowed to be 
an arithmetic expression even though the value 
of v may be 0.)

Give derivations showing that each of the following is an arithmetic expression.
a. ((2 . (0.3 - 4.2)) + (-7))
answer:
1. by rule I, 2, 0.3, 4.2, and 7 is a real number r, and is therefore an arithmetic expression
2, by 1 and IIb, -7 is an arithmetic expression
2. by 1 and IId, (0.3 - 4.2) is an arithmetic expression
3. by 1, 3, and IIe, (2 * (0.3 - 4.2)) is an arithmetic expression
4. by 2, 4, and  rule IIc, ((2 * (0.3 - 4.2)) + (-7)) is an arithmetic expression

b. ((9 . (6.1+2))/((4-7).6))
answer:
1. by rule I, 9,6,1,2,4,7 are real number r and is therefore an arithmetic expression
2. by 1 and IIe, 6 * 1 is an arithmetic expression
3. by 2 and IIc, 6 * 1 + 2 is an arithmetic expression
4. by 1 and rule IId, 4 - 7 is an arithmetic expression
5. by 3, 4, and rule IIe, (9 * (6 . 1 + 2)) and ((4 - 7) * 6) is an arithmetic expression
6. by rule IIf, ((9 . (6.1+2))/((4-7).6)) is an arithmetic expression

6. let S be a set of integers defined recursively as follows:
I. base: 5 in S
II. Recursion:  Recursion: Given any integer n in S, n + 4 is in S
III. restriction: no integers are in S other than those derived from rules I and II above.

use structural induction to prove that for every integer n in S, n mod 2 = 1
answer:

proof by structural induction
base case -> show that p(n) is true for each integer n in the base for S
the only object is 5 in S, so 5 mod 2 = 1 is true since it leaves a reminder of 1

inductive hypothesis: assume that for an arbitrary integer n in S, the property n mod 2 = 1 is true
so n = 2k + 1

we must show that p(n+4) is true, that is n+4 mod 2 = 1 is true
we can rewrite n+4 mod 2 = 1 as
n + 4 = 2k + 1 -> since earlier we assumed n = 2k+1 we can substitute
2k+1+4
2 (k + 2) + 1
therefore proven
