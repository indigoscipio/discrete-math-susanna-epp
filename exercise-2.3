1. for an argument t be valid means that eveery argument of the same form whose premises are true has a true conclusion
2. for an argument to be invalid means that there is an argument of the same form whose premises are true and whose conslusion is false
3. for an argument to be sound means that is valid and its premises are true. in tis case we can be sure that its conclusion is also true.

exercise set 2.3
 Use modus ponens or modus tollens to fill in the blanks in 
the arguments of 1–5 so as to produce valid inferences.

1) if sqrt 2 if rational (p), then sqrt 2 = a/b for some integers a and b (q)
it is not true that sqrt 2 = a/b for some integers a and b (q)
p -> q
~q
therefore ~p (modus tollens)

2) if 1 - 0.9999.... is less than every positive real number (p), then it equals zero (q)
the number 1  - 0.9999 ... equals zero (q)
p -> q
fill in this one: P
therefore q (modus ponens)

3)
p1 : if logic is easy, then i am monkey's uncle
p2: i am not a monkey's uncle
p1: p -> q
p2: ~q
conclusion: therfore ~p - logic is not easy (modus tollens)


4)p1: if this graph can be colored with three colors, then it can be colored with four (p -> q)
p2: this graph cannot be colored with four colors (~q)
c: therefore ~p - this graph cannot be oclores with three colors (modus tollens)

5. p1: if they were unsure of the address, then they would have telephones (p -> q)
p2: fill in this one - ~q = they wouldn't have telephoned
c = they were sure of the address (~p)

Use truth tables to determine whether the argument forms 
in 6–11 are valid. Indicate which columns represent the 
premises and which represent the conclusion, and include 
a sentence explaining how the truth table supports your 
answer. Your explanation should show that you understand 
what it means for a form of argument to be valid or invalid..

argument is valid because no case where all premises are true but conclusion is false is found

 Use symbols to write the logical form of each argument 
in 22 and 23, and then use a truth table to test the argu
ment for validity. Indicate which columns represent the 
premises and which represent the conclusion, and include 
a few words of explanation showing that you understand 
the meaning of validity.

This argument is also not valid bcause ther's a occurence where all premises are true but the concusion is false on row 1 and 5

 Some of the arguments in 24–32 are valid, whereas others 
exhibit the converse or the inverse error. Use symbols to 
write the logical form of each argument. If the argument 
is valid, identify the rule of inference that guarantees its 
validity. Otherwise, state whether the converse or the 
inverse error is made.
24. p1: If Jules solved this problem correctly, then Jules obtained the answer 2.
p2: Jules obtained the answer 2.
c: Jules solved this problem correctly.

p = jules solve the math problem correctly
q = jules obrained the answer 2
p1: p -> q

This is a valid argument (rules of inference is elimination)

26. p1: If i go to the movies, i won't finish my homework
p2: If i don't finish my homework, i won't do well on the exam tomorrow
c: if i go to the moveies, i won't do well on the exam tomorrow
p: i go to the movies
q = i don't finish my homework
r = i won't do well on the exam tomorrow
p1: p -> q
p2: q -> r
c: p -> r
This is a valid statement (by rule of transitivity)

27. p1: If this number is larger than 2, then its square is larger than 4.
p2: this number is not larger than 2
c: the square of this number is not larger than 4
p = this number is larger tan 2
q = the square is larger than 4
p1: p -> q
p2: ~p
c: ~q
This argument is invalid because of inverse error

28. p1: If there are as many rational numbers as there are irrational numbers, then the set of all irrational numbers is infinite.
p2: the set of all irrational numbers is infinite
c: there are as many rational numbers as there are irrational numberes
p = there are as many rational numbers as there are irraitonal numbers
q = the set of all irrational numbers is infinite
p1: p -> q
p2: q
p3: p
This argument is invalid because of converse error

29. p1: If at least one of these two numbers is divisible by 6, then the product of these two numbers is divisible by 6. 
p2: Neither of these two numbers is divisible by 6
c: the product of thes two numbers is not divisible by 6
p: at least one of these two numbers is divisible by 6
q: the product of these two numbers is divisible by 6
p1: p -> q
p2: ~p
c: ~q
this is an invalid argument due to the inverse error

30. p1: If this computer program is correct, then it produces the correct output when run with the test data my teacher gave me.
p2:  This computer program produces the correct output when run with the test data my teacher gave me.
c: this computer program is correct

p: this comp program is corect
q: it produces the correct ouput when run with test data my teacher gave me
p1: p -> q
p2: q
c:  p
this argument is invalid because of the converse error

31. p1: sandra knows java and sandra knows C++
c: sandra knows C++
p1: p V q
c: q
this argument is valid because of the generalization rule of inference

32. p1: if i get a christmas bonus, i'll buy a streo
p2: if i sell my motorcycle, i ll buy a stereo
c: if i get a christmas bonus or i sell my motorcycle, then ill buy a stereo

p: i get a christmas bonus
q: i buy a stereo
r: i sell my motorcycle
p1: p -> q
p2: r -> q
c: p V r -> q

valid because of the division into cases

33. Give an example (other than Example 2.3.11) of a 
valid argument with a false conclusion.

p1: all cars can fly
p2: If all cars can fly, then all cars are aeroplanes.
c:  Therefore, all cars are aeroplanes. (p -> q)

34. Give an example (other than Example 2.3.12) of an 
invalid argument with a true conclusion.

p1: if videogames make people violence, then all videogames are dangerous
p2: all videogames are dangerous
c: videogames make people violence

35. Explain in your own words what distinguishes a 
valid form of argument from an invalid one.

answer: a valid form of argument is where all of the premises are true and conclusion is also true. If the premises are all true but conclusion is false it's not a valid argument.

36. Given the following information about a computer 
program, find the mistake in the program.

a. There is an undeclared variable or there is a 
syntax error in the first five lines.
p = undeclared variable
q = syntax error in the first five lines
p V q

b. if theres a syntax error in the first five lines, then there is a missing semicolon or a variable name is mispelled
r = theres a missing semicolon
s = variable name is mispeled
q -> r V s

c. there is not a missing semicolon
~r

d. there is not a mispelled variable name
~s

~q
therefore p

answer: there is an undeclared variable (p)

37.  In the back of an old cupboard you discover a note 
signed by a pirate famous for his bizarre sense of 
humor and love of logical puzzles. In the note he 
wrote that he had hidden treasure somewhere on 
the property. He listed five true statements (a–e 
below) and challenged the reader to use them to 
figure out the location of the treasure.

a. If this house is next to a lake, then the treasure is not in the kitchen.
p = house is next to a lake
q = treasure is in the kitchen
r = tree in the front yars is an elm
s = treasure is buried under the flagpole

p -> ~q

b. if the tree in the front yard is an elm, then the trasure is in the kitchen
r -> q

c. the house is next to a lake
p is true
therfore ~q is true (treasure is not in the kitchen)
and ~r is true (tree in the front yard is not an elm)

d. tree in the front yard is an elm or the treasure is buried under the flagpole
r V s

e. if tree in the back yard is an oak, then the treasure is in the garage
~r -> ~s

where is the treasure hidden?
p -> ~q
r -> q
p is true
r V s
therefore the treasure is located in the garage

38 You are visiting the island described in Example 
2.3.14 (knights & knaves) and have the following encounters with 
natives.

a) Two natives A and B address you as follows:
A says: Both of us are knights.
B says: A is a knave.
what are a and b?

suppose A is knight
that makes A: both of us are knights true and makes B false
B says a is a knave should also be true but it's a contradiction, therefore A is not a knight

suppose B is knight:
A is a knafe is true and there's no contradiction.

therefore A is knave and B is knight


b) Another two natives C and D approach you but 
only C speaks.
 C says: Both of us are knaves.
 What are C and D?

 suppose C is a knight.
 Both of us are knaves - this automatically contradicts the argument (it's not possible to say c is a knight and say he's a knave)
 therfore C is not a knight

 suppose both are knights. - again impossible since C knight = contradiction
 Suppose C is not a knight
 what C said is false - so both of us are not knaves, which means theres 1 knight and 1 knave

c. You then encounter natives E and F.
 E says: F is a knave.
 F says: E is a knave.
 How many knaves are there?

 Suppose E is a knight:  this means F is a knave
 Therefore E is a knafe is not true, so E is not a knafe - this is valid

 suppose F is a knight: this means E is a knave
 therefore F is a knave is not true, so F is not a knve - also valid

 suppose E and F are both knights
this cannot be a valid argument because if E is a knight, then F must be a knave. and if F is a knight , then E is a knave.
This is a contradiction so both of them cannot be knights

 suppose E is a knave and F is a knight:
 E says: F is a knave (false)
 So f is a knight
 F says: E is a knave = true - this is a valid argument

 Suppose E and F are both knaves
 E says: F is a knave (false), so F is a knight
 F sas: E is a knave (false), so E is a knight
 this is a contradiction, therefore there is 1 knight and 1 knave

d. Finally, you meet a group of six natives, U, V, 
W, X, Y, and Z, who speak to you as follows:
U: none of us is a knight
V: at least three of us are knights
W: at most three of us are knights
X: exactly five of us are knights
Y: exactly two of us are knights
Z: exactly one of us is a knight

Suppose U is a knight. 
None of us is a knight = true
Contradiction -> total number of knight is not 0
Therfore U is a knave

Suppose V is a knight
At least three of us are knights >= 3
U = none of us is a knight = false
V = at least three of us are knights = true
W: at most three of us are knights = true
X = exactly five of us are knights = false
Y = exactly two of us are knights = true
Z = exactly one of us is a knight = false

39. The famous detective Percule Hoirot was called in 
to solve a baffling murder mystery. He determined 
the following facts:
a. Lord Hazelton, the murdered man, was killed 
by a blow on the head with a brass candlestick.
b, Either Lady Hazelton or a maid, Sara, was in 
the dining room at the time of the murder.
c. If the cook was in the kitchen at the time of the 
murder, then the butler killed Lord Hazelton 
d. If Lady Hazelton was in the dining room at the 
time of the murder, then the chauffeur killed 
Lord Hazelton.
e. If the cook was not in the kitchen at the time 
of the murder, then Sara was not in the dining 
room when the murder was committed.
f. If Sara was in the dining room at the time the 
murder was committed, then the wine steward 
killed Lord Hazelton.

X = kill

p = lord hazleton
q = lady hazleton
r = sara (maid)
s = cook
t = butler
u = chauffeur
v = wine steward

A = blow on the head with brass candlestick
B = dining room
C = kitchen

a. p X a
b. qB V rB
c. sC -> t X p
d. qB -> u X p
e. ~sC -> ~rB
f. rB -> v X p

Susppose qB v Rb is true
this makes u X p true (chauffeur killed lord hazleton)
and also makes v X p true (wine chauffer killed lord hazleton)

suppose sC is true, this maes t X p true (butler killed lord hazleton)
qB v rB is true (lady hazleton and sara is in the dining room) is true
qB -> u X p is true (hauffeur killed lord hazleton) - this is a contraditction therefore sC -> t x P is false (butler didn't kill lord hazleton)


suppose ~sC is true, this makes ~rB true (sara is not in the dining room)
which makes v X p not true (wine steward iddn't kill lord hazleton)
which makse qB v ~rB = qB is true
if qB is true, then u X p is true (cahauffeur kils lord hazleton)

41. Sharky, a leader of the underworld, was killed by 
one of his own band of four henchmen. Detective 
Sharp interviewed the men and determined that all 
were lying except for one. He deduced who killed 
Sharky on the basis of the following statements:
a. Socko: Lefty killed Sharky.
b. Fats: Muscles didn’t kill Sharky.
c. Lefty: Muscles was shooting craps with Socko when Sharky was knocked off.
d. Muscles: Lefty didn’t kill Sharky.

Who did kill Sharky?

X = kill
C = shooting craps

l = Lefty
so = Socko
sh = Sharky
f = fats
m = muscles

A. Socko: lXsh
B. Fats: ~mXsh
C. Lefty: mCso
D. Muscles: ~lXsh

All are lying except for one

suppose Socko is the killer
this means A is false
B is true
C isfalse
D is true
total: 2 true and 1 false

suppose Fats is the killer
statement B is true
statement A is false
stemeent C is true
statement D is true
total: 2 true and 1 false

suppose Lefty is the killer
statement D is false
statement C is true
statement B is true
statement A is true
total: 3 true and 1  false

Suppose muscle is the killer
this means statment D is true (lefty didn't kill sharky)
A is false
B is false
C is also false
total: 3 false: therefore muscle is the killer

 In 41–44 a set of premises and a conclusion are given. Use 
the valid argument forms listed in Table 2.3.1 to deduce the 
conclusion from the premises, giving a reason for each step as 
in Example 2.3.8. Assume all variables are statement variables.
