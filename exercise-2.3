1. for an argument t be valid means that eveery argument of the same form whose premises are true has a true conclusion
2. for an argument to be invalid means that there is an argument of the same form whose premises are true and whose conslusion is false
3. for an argument to be sound means that is valid and its premises are true. in tis case we can be sure that its conclusion is also true.

exercise set 2.3
 Use modus ponens or modus tollens to fill in the blanks in 
the arguments of 1–5 so as to produce valid inferences.

1) if sqrt 2 if rational (p), then sqrt 2 = a/b for some integers a and b (q)
it is not true that sqrt 2 = a/b for some integers a and b (q)
p -> q
~q
therefore ~p (modus tollens)

2) if 1 - 0.9999.... is less than every positive real number (p), then it equals zero (q)
the number 1  - 0.9999 ... equals zero (q)
p -> q
fill in this one: P
therefore q (modus ponens)

3)
p1 : if logic is easy, then i am monkey's uncle
p2: i am not a monkey's uncle
p1: p -> q
p2: ~q
conclusion: therfore ~p - logic is not easy (modus tollens)


4)p1: if this graph can be colored with three colors, then it can be colored with four (p -> q)
p2: this graph cannot be colored with four colors (~q)
c: therefore ~p - this graph cannot be oclores with three colors (modus tollens)

5. p1: if they were unsure of the address, then they would have telephones (p -> q)
p2: fill in this one - ~q = they wouldn't have telephoned
c = they were sure of the address (~p)

Use truth tables to determine whether the argument forms 
in 6–11 are valid. Indicate which columns represent the 
premises and which represent the conclusion, and include 
a sentence explaining how the truth table supports your 
answer. Your explanation should show that you understand 
what it means for a form of argument to be valid or invalid..
