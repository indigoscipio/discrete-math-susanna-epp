1. mathematical induction is a method for proving that a property defined for integers n
is true for all values n that are ____
answer: greater or equal to some initial value

2. let p(n) be a property defined for integers n and consider constructing a proof by mathematical induction
for the statement P(n) is true for all n >= a
a) in the  basis step one must show that ____
b) in the inductive step one supposes that ___
for a particular but arbitrarily chosen value of an integer k>=a
This supposition is called the ____
one then has to show that ____

answer:
a.  P(a) is true
b. P(k) must be true
inductive hypothesis
p(k+1) is also true and compare the right and left hand side of the equality.
