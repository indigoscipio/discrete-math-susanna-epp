1. mathematical induction is a method for proving that a property defined for integers n
is true for all values n that are ____
answer: greater or equal to some initial value

2. let p(n) be a property defined for integers n and consider constructing a proof by mathematical induction
for the statement P(n) is true for all n >= a
a) in the  basis step one must show that ____
b) in the inductive step one supposes that ___
for a particular but arbitrarily chosen value of an integer k>=a
This supposition is called the ____
one then has to show that ____

answer:
a.  P(a) is true
b. P(k) must be true
inductive hypothesis
p(k+1) is also true and compare the right and left hand side of the equality.

1. use the technique illustrated at thebeginning of this section to show that the statements in
a and b are true
a)
if (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) = 1/5 then
(1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) = 1/6

replace (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) by 1/5
1/5 . (1-1/6) = 1/6
1/5 . (6/6-1/6) = 1/6
1/5 . (5/6) = 1/6
1/6 = 1/6

b) 
if (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) = 1/6 then
(1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) (1-1/7) = 1/7

1/6 . (1-1/7) = 1/7
1/6 . (7/7-1/7) = 1/7
1/6 . 6/7 = 1/7
1/7 = 1/7

2. for each positive integer n,
let P(n) be the formula
1+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2

a. write p(1). is p(1) true?
answer:
1 = 1^2
1 = 1 -> therefore p(1 is true)

b. write p(k).
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k^2

c. write p(k+1).
1 + 3  + 5 + ... + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)^2
= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+2-1) = (k+1)^2
= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = (k+1)(k+1)
= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1

d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the formula holds
for every integer n>= 1, what must be shown in the inductive step?

answer: we must use inductive hyphothesis  show the right hand equation is equal to left hand

left side -> = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 2k+1
=  1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 2k - 1 + (2k+1)
= k^2 + 2k+1

right hand -> k^2 + 2k + 1
therefore both left and right side is true


3. for each positive integer n
let P(n) be the formula
1^2+2^2+...+n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6


a. write p(1). is p(1) true?
1 = 1(1+1)(2.1+1)/6
1 = 1.2 (2+1)/6
1 = 2 . 3 / 6
1 = 6 / 6 threfore it's true

b. write p(k)
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + k^2 = k(k + 1)(2k + 1) / 6

c. write p(k+1).
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (k+1)^2 = (k+1) ((k+1)+1) (2(k+1)+1) / 6

d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the ofrumla holds
for every integer n>= 1, what must be shown in the inductive step?
answer: we must use inductive hypothesis to show that the right hand size is equal to the left hand side

left side -> 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + ( (k+1) ^2)
= 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (k^2) + ( (k+1) ^2)
= k(k + 1)(2k + 1) / 6 + ((k+1)^2)
= k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 + 6((k+1)^2)/ 6
= k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 + 6k^2+12k+6)/6
= 2k^3 + 9k^2 + 13k + 6 / 6

right side -> (k+1) ((k+1)+1) (2(k+1)+1) / 6
= (k+1) ((k+1)+1) (2(k+1)+1) / 6
= (k+1) (k+2) (2k+3) / 6
= (k^2 + 2k + k + 2) (2k + 3) / 6
= (k^2 + 3k + 2) (2k + 3) / 6
= 2k^3 + 3k^2 + 6k^2 + 9k + 4k + 6 / 6
= 2k^3 + 9k^2 + 13k + + / 6

therfore the left side and right side is equal

4. for each integer n with n>=2, let p(n) be the formula
sigma(from i = 1 to n - 1 of i(i+1)) = n(n-1)(n+1) / 3

a. write p(2). is p(2 true)?
LHS
sigma(from i = 1 to 1 of i(i+1))
= 1(1+1)
= 1(2) = 2

RHS
= 2(2-1) (2 + 1) / 3
= 2(1)(3)/3
= 6 / 3
= 2
therefpre p(2) = 2 = true

b. write P(k)
sigma(from i = 1 to k-1 of i(i+1)) = k(k-1)(k+1) / 3

c. write P(k+1)
sigma(from i = 1 to k of i(i+1) ) = (k+1)((k+1)-1)((k+1)+1) / 3
= sigma(from i = 1 to k of i(i+1)) = (k+1)(k)(k+2) / 3

d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the ofrumla holds
for every integer n>= 2, what must be shown in the inductive step?
answer: we must use inductive hypothesis to show that the right hand size is equal to the left hand side

left hand -> sigma(from i = 1 to k of i(i+1))
= sigma(from i = 1 to k-1 of i(i+1)) + k(k + 1)
= k(k-1)(k+1) / 3 + k(k+1)
=  k(k-1)(k+1) / 3 + 3(k(k+1))/3
= k(k+1)(k+2)+3/3

right hand -> (k+1)(k)(k+2) / 3
therefore the two sides are equal

5. fill in the missing pieces in the following proof that

1+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2
for every integer n>=1

 Show that P(1) is true: To establish P(1), we must 
show that when 1 is substituted in place of n, the 
left-hand side equals the right-hand side. But when 
n=1, the left-hand side is the sum of all the odd 
integers from 1 to 2.1-1, which is the sum of the 
odd integers from 1 to 1 and is just 1. The right-hand 
side is (a) , which also equals 1. So P(1) is true.
 Show that for every integer k>=1, if P(k) is true 
then P(k+1) is true: Let k be any integer with 
k>=1.

[suppose p(k) is true, that is] Suppose
1+3+5+...+(2k-1) = (b) - by p(k)

[this is the inductive hypothesis]
we must show that
(c) = (d) - by p(k+1)

now the left hand size of p(k+1) is
1+3+5+...+(2(k+1)-1)
= 1 + 3 +5+...+(2k+1) by algebra
= [1+3+5+...+(2k-1)]+(2k+1)
the next to last term is (2k-1) because (e)
= k^2 + (2k+1) by (f)
= (k+1)^2 by algebra

 which is the right-hand side of P(k+1) [as was to 
be shown].
 [Since we have proved the basis step and the induc
tive step, we conclude that the given statement is 
true.]
 Note: This proof was annotated to help make its 
logical flow more obvious. In standard mathemati
cal writing, such annotation is omitted.

answer:
a) n^2 = 1^1 = 1
b) k^2
c) 1+3+5+...+(2(k+1)-1)
d) (k+1)^2
e) the sequence distance is increased by 2 (2k-1 to 2k+1 is 2)
f) subsituting next to lsat term  p(k) = k^2

Prove each statements in 6-9 using the mathematical induction.
Do not derive them from theorem 5.2.1 of theorem 5.2.2

6. for every integer n>=1,
2+4+6+...+2n = n^2+n

First, we need to show that for ever integer n>=1, p(1) is true
left hand side -> 2(1) = 2
right hand side -> 1^2 + 1 = 2
therefore the basis p(1) is true

next we must show that for every integer k>=1, if p(k) is true, then p(k+1) is true

p(k) = 2+4+6+...+2k = k^2 + k
p(k+1) = 2+4+6+...+2(k+1) = (k+1)^2 + (k+1)

LHS of p(k+1)
= 2+4+6+...+2(k+1)
= [2+4+6+...+ 2k] + 2(k+1)
= k^2 + k + 2k+2
= k^2 + 3k + 2

RHS of p(k+1)
= (k+1)^2 + (k+1) 
= (k+1)(k+1) + (k+1)
= k^2 + 2k + 1 + k+1
= k^2 + 3k +  2

since the lhs and rhs is equal, therefore we have proved the basic stpe and inductive step and conclude that
the given statmenent is true

7. for every integer n>=1
1+6+11+16+...+(5n-4) = n(5n-3)/2

First, we need to show that for ever integer n>=1, p(1) is true
left hand side -> 5 - 4 = 1
right hand side -> 2/2 = 1
therefore the basis p(1) is true

next we must show that for every integer k>=1, if p(k) is true, then p(k+1) is true
p(k) -> 1+6+11+16+...+(5k-4) = k(5k-3)/2
p(k+1) -> 1+6+11+16+...+(5(k+1)-4) = (k+1)(5(k+1)-3)/2

LHS of p(k+1)
= 1+6+11+16+...+ (5(k+1)-4)
= [1+6+11+16+...+ (5k-4)] + 5 (k+1)-4)
= k(5k-3)/2 + 5(k+1)-4
= 5k^2+7k+2/2

RHS
= (k+1)(5(k+1)-3)/2
= (k+1).(5k+5-3)/2
= (k+1).(5k+2)/2
= (5k^2+2k+5k+2)/2
= 5k^2+7k+2/2

8. for every integer n>= 0
1+2+2^2+...+2^n = 2^n+1 - 1

First, we need to show that for ever integer n>=0, p(0) is true
left hand side -> 2^0 = 1
right hand side -> 2^0+1 - 1 = 1
therefore the basis p(0) is true

next we must show that for every integer k>=0, if p(k) is true, then p(k+1) is true
p(k) -> 1+2+2^2+...+2^k = 2^k+1 - 1
p(k+1) -> 1+2+2^2+...+2^k+1 = 2^(k+1+1) - 1

LHS of p(k+1)
1+2+2^2+...+2^k+1
= [1+2+2^2+...+ 2^k] + 2^k+1
= 2^k+1 - 1 + 2^k+1
= 2^k+2 - 1

RHS of p(k+1)
2^(k+1+1) - 1
= 2^k+2 - 1

[therefore lhs and rhs is equal, statement is true]

9. for every integer n>=3
4^3+4^4+4^5+...+4^n = 4(4^n - 16) / 3

First, we need to show that for ever integer n>=0, p(0) is true
left hand side -> 2^0 = 1
right hand side -> 2^0+1 - 1 = 1
therefore the basis p(0) is true
