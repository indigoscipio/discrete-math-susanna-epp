1. mathematical induction is a method for proving that a property defined for integers n
is true for all values n that are ____
answer: greater or equal to some initial value

2. let p(n) be a property defined for integers n and consider constructing a proof by mathematical induction
for the statement P(n) is true for all n >= a
a) in the  basis step one must show that ____
b) in the inductive step one supposes that ___
for a particular but arbitrarily chosen value of an integer k>=a
This supposition is called the ____
one then has to show that ____

answer:
a.  P(a) is true
b. P(k) must be true
inductive hypothesis
p(k+1) is also true and compare the right and left hand side of the equality.

1. use the technique illustrated at thebeginning of this section to show that the statements in
a and b are true
a)
if (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) = 1/5 then
(1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) = 1/6

replace (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) by 1/5
1/5 . (1-1/6) = 1/6
1/5 . (6/6-1/6) = 1/6
1/5 . (5/6) = 1/6
1/6 = 1/6

b) 
if (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) = 1/6 then
(1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) (1-1/7) = 1/7

1/6 . (1-1/7) = 1/7
1/6 . (7/7-1/7) = 1/7
1/6 . 6/7 = 1/7
1/7 = 1/7

2. for each positive integer n,
let P(n) be the formula
1+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2

a. write p(1). is p(1) true?
answer:
1 = 1^2
1 = 1 -> therefore p(1 is true)

b. write p(k).
1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k^2

c. write p(k+1).
1 + 3  + 5 + ... + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)^2
= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+2-1) = (k+1)^2
= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = (k+1)(k+1)
= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1

d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the formula holds
for every integer n>= 1, what must be shown in the inductive step?

answer: we must use inductive hyphothesis  show the right hand equation is equal to left hand

left side -> = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 2k+1
=  1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 2k - 1 + (2k+1)
= k^2 + 2k+1

right hand -> k^2 + 2k + 1
therefore both left and right side is true


3. for each positive integer n
let P(n) be the formula
1^2+2^2+...+n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6


a. write p(1). is p(1) true?
1 = 1(1+1)(2.1+1)/6
1 = 1.2 (2+1)/6
1 = 2 . 3 / 6
1 = 6 / 6 threfore it's true

b. write p(k)
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + k^2 = k(k + 1)(2k + 1) / 6

c. write p(k+1).
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (k+1)^2 = (k+1) ((k+1)+1) (2(k+1)+1) / 6

d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the ofrumla holds
for every integer n>= 1, what must be shown in the inductive step?
answer: we must use inductive hypothesis to show that the right hand size is equal to the left hand side

left side -> 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + ( (k+1) ^2)
= 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + (k^2) + ( (k+1) ^2)
= k(k + 1)(2k + 1) / 6 + ((k+1)^2)
= k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 + 6((k+1)^2)/ 6
= k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 + 6k^2+12k+6)/6
= 2k^3 + 9k^2 + 13k + 6 / 6

right side -> (k+1) ((k+1)+1) (2(k+1)+1) / 6
= (k+1) ((k+1)+1) (2(k+1)+1) / 6
= (k+1) (k+2) (2k+3) / 6
= (k^2 + 2k + k + 2) (2k + 3) / 6
= (k^2 + 3k + 2) (2k + 3) / 6
= 2k^3 + 3k^2 + 6k^2 + 9k + 4k + 6 / 6
= 2k^3 + 9k^2 + 13k + + / 6

therfore the left side and right side is equal

4. for each integer n with n>=2, let p(n) be the formula
sigma(from i = 1 to n - 1 of i(i+1)) = n(n-1)(n+1) / 3

a. write p(2). is p(2 true)?
LHS
sigma(from i = 1 to 1 of i(i+1))
= 1(1+1)
= 1(2) = 2

RHS
= 2(2-1) (2 + 1) / 3
= 2(1)(3)/3
= 6 / 3
= 2
therefpre p(2) = 2 = true

b. write P(k)
sigma(from i = 1 to k-1 of i(i+1)) = k(k-1)(k+1) / 3

c. write P(k+1)
sigma(from i = 1 to k of i(i+1) ) = (k+1)((k+1)-1)((k+1)+1) / 3
= sigma(from i = 1 to k of i(i+1)) = (k+1)(k)(k+2) / 3

d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the ofrumla holds
for every integer n>= 2, what must be shown in the inductive step?
answer: we must use inductive hypothesis to show that the right hand size is equal to the left hand side

left hand -> sigma(from i = 1 to k of i(i+1))
= sigma(from i = 1 to k-1 of i(i+1)) + k(k + 1)
= k(k-1)(k+1) / 3 + k(k+1)
=  k(k-1)(k+1) / 3 + 3(k(k+1))/3
= k(k+1)(k+2)+3/3

right hand -> (k+1)(k)(k+2) / 3
therefore the two sides are euql
