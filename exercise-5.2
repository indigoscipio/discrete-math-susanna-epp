1. mathematical induction is a method for proving that a property defined for integers n
is true for all values n that are ____
answer: greater or equal to some initial value

2. let p(n) be a property defined for integers n and consider constructing a proof by mathematical induction
for the statement P(n) is true for all n >= a
a) in the  basis step one must show that ____
b) in the inductive step one supposes that ___
for a particular but arbitrarily chosen value of an integer k>=a
This supposition is called the ____
one then has to show that ____

answer:
a.  P(a) is true
b. P(k) must be true
inductive hypothesis
p(k+1) is also true and compare the right and left hand side of the equality.

1. use the technique illustrated at thebeginning of this section to show that the statements in
a and b are true
a)
if (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) = 1/5 then
(1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) = 1/6

replace (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) by 1/5
1/5 . (1-1/6) = 1/6
1/5 . (6/6-1/6) = 1/6
1/5 . (5/6) = 1/6
1/6 = 1/6

b) 
if (1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) = 1/6 then
(1-1/2) (1-1/3) (1-1/4) (1-1/5) (1-1/6) (1-1/7) = 1/7

1/6 . (1-1/7) = 1/7
1/6 . (7/7-1/7) = 1/7
1/6 . 6/7 = 1/7
1/7 = 1/7

2. for each positive integer n, let P(n) be the formula
1+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2

a. write p(1). is p(1) true?
b. write p(k).
c. write p(k+1).
d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the ofrumla holds
for every integer n>= 1, what must be shown in the inductive step?

3. for each positive integer n, let P(n) be the formula
1^2+3+5+...+(2n-1) = n^2

a. write p(1). is p(1) true?
b. write p(k).
c. write p(k+1).
d. in a proof by mathemtical induction that the ofrumla holds
for every integer n>= 1, what must be shown in the inductive step?
