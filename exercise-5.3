answer: prove

exercise set 5.3
1. use mathemtical induction (and proof of proposition 5.3.1 as a model)
to show that any amount of money of at least 14cents can be made up using 3cent and 8cent coin


for every integer  n>=14, n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 8cent coin

let the property p(n) be the folowing:

n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 8cent coin

show that p(14) is true
p(14) is true because 14 cent can be obtained with one 8cent coin and 2x3 cent coin

show that for every integer k>=14, if p(k) is true, then p(k+1) is also true

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=14. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 14 such that

k cent can be obtained using 3c and 8c coin

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 cent can be obtained using 3c and 8c coints
case 1:
there is a 8c coin among those used to make up the kc
in this case replace the 8c with 3x 3c coins to obtain (k+1)

case 2:
there is a not a 8c coin among those used to make up the kc)
since k>= 14 we must have at least 5x 3c coins
to obtain k+1 wen can replace 5x 3c coin with 2x 8c coin

[since k+1 is true for both cases in inductive step, therefore this is rue]


2. use mathematical induction to show that any postage of at least 12c
can be obtained using 3c and 7c coin

for every integer  n>=12, n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 7cent coin

let the property p(n) be the folowing:
n postage cents can be obtained using 3cent and 7cent stamps

show that p12 is true: it can be purchased with 4x 3c coin

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=12. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 12 such that

k postage cents can be obtained using 3cent and 7cent stamps

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 cent can be obtained using 3c and 7c coints
case 1
if the k cent of postage includes at least 2 3cent stamp
we can replace it with one 7c stamp to get k+1

case 2:
there is a not a 7c coin among those used to make up the kc
since k>= 12 we must have at least 4x 3c coins
to obtain k+1 wen can replace 2x 3c coin with 1x 7c coin

[since k+1 is true for both cases in inductive step, therefore this is rue]

3. stamps are sold in packages containing either 5 stamps or 8 stamps
a. show that a person can obtain 5,8,10,13,15,16,20,21,24, or 25 stamps by collection of 5 stamp packages
and 8 stamp packages

answer:
5 stamps: 1x 5s
8 stamps: 1x 8s
10 stamps: 2x 5s
13 stamps: 1x 5s + 1x 8s
15: 3x 5s
16: 2x 8s
20: 4x 5s
21: 2x 8s + 1x 5s
24: 3x 8s
25: 5x 5s

b. use mathematical induction to show that any quantity of at least 28 stamps can be obtained
by buying a collection of 5 stamp packages and 8 stamp packages


for every integer  n>=28, n stamps can be obtained by buying a collection of 5stamp and 8stamp packages

base case
we must show that p(28) is true for integer n >=28
28 = 4x 5stamps + 1x 8stamps
therefore p(28) is true

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=28. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 28 such that

k stamps can be obtained by buying a collection of 5stamp and 8stamp packages

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 stamps can be obtained by buying a collection of 5stamp and 8stamp packages

case 1:
k stamps include at least 3x 5 stamp package
take out 3x 5stamp package and replace it with 2x 8stamp package to achieve k+1

case 2:
if case1 doesn't apply (we only have 0x,1x, or 2x 5stamps) we must have enough n x 8stamp package
the maximum amount of 5x stamp in this case is 2x 5stamp
since k>=28, the remaining stamp must come from 28-10 = 18 stamps
since 18 > 2x8 = 18 > 16 this means mwe must have at least 3 8stamp package  because 3x8 = 24
take out 3x8stmap package and repalce them with 5x5stamp = 25 stamps to achieve k+1


4. for each positive integer n, let p(n) be the sentence
that describes the ollowing divisibility property

5^n - 1 is divisible by 4

a. write p(0), is p(0) true?

p(0) -> 5^0 - 1 is divisible by 4
0 is divisibile by 4
therefore p(0) is true

b. write p(k)
p(k) -> 5^k - 1 is divisible by 4
5^k-1 = 4r
5^k = 4r+1

c. write p(k+1)
p(k+1) = 5^k+1 - 1 is divisible by 4

d. in a proof by mathematical induction that this divisibility property holds for every integer n>=0
what must be shown in the inductive step?

we must show that p(k+1) is divisibile by 4

an integer m is divisile by 4 if and only if m = 4r for some integer r

p(k+1) -> 5^k+1 - 1
= 5^k . 5 - 1
= (4r+1) . 5 - 1
= 20r+5 - 1
= 20r + 4
= 4 (5r + 1)

since p(k+1) has the form of 4 . some integer therefore it's divisible by 4


5. for each positive integer n, let p(n) be the inequality

2^n < (n+1)!

a. write p2. is p(2) true?

p(2) -> 2^2 < (2+1)!
= 4 < 3!
= 4 < 3.2.1
= 4 < 6
therefore p(2) is true

b. write p(k)
p(k) -> 2^k < (k+1)!

c. write p(k+1)
p(k+1) -> 2^k+1 < (k+2)!

d. in a proof by mathematical induction that this divisibility property holds for every integer n>=2
what must be shown in the inductive step?

we must show that for every integer k>=2, if p(k) is true then p(k+1) is also true

inductive hypothesis: 2^k < (k+1)!

we must show p(k+1) is true
we must show 2^k+1 < (k+2)!

2^k+1 < (k+2)!
= 2^k . 2
= (k+1)! . 2 < (k+2)(k+1)!
= 2 < k + 2

since k >= 2 therefore the inequality is true


6. For each positive integer n, let P(n) be the sentence
Any checkerboard with dimensions 2 x 3n can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes.

a. Write P(1). Is P(1) true?
p(1) -> Any checkerboard with dimensions 2 x 3 can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes.
this is true because a trominoe can cover at least 2x2 checkerboard

b. Write P(k).
p(k) ->  Any checkerboard with dimensions 2 x 3k can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes.

c. Write P(k+1).
p(k+1) ->  Any checkerboard with dimensions 2 x 3k+1 can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes.

d. In a proof by mathematical induction that P(n) is true for each integer n >= 1, what must be 
shown in the inductive step? 

we must show that for every integer k>=2, if p(k) is true then p(k+1) is also true

inductive hypothesis: Any checkerboard with dimensions 2 x 3k can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes.

we must show p(k+1) is true
we must show Any checkerboard with dimensions 2 x 3k+1 can be completely covered with L-shaped trominoes.

consider a 2x 3k+1 checkerboard. since one trominoe 3 covers square grid then the checkerboard is needs to be
divisible by 3

at a minimum 2 x 3 = 6 total cell, which means the whole checkerboard can be filled with trominoes isnce 6 is divisible by 3
2 x 4 = 8 ?????




7. For each positive integer n, let P(n) be the sentence

In any round-robin tournament involving n 
teams, the teams can be labeled T1, T2, T3, ... , Tn, 
so that Ti beats Ti+1 for every i = 1,2,...,n

a. Write P(2). Is P(2) true?
b. Write P(k).
c. Write P(k+1).
d. In a proof by mathematical induction that P(n) 
is true for each integer n >= 2, what must be 
shown in the inductive step?
