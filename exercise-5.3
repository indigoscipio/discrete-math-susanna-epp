answer: deductive


2. mathematical induction can be used to ___
conjectures that have been made using inductive reasoning
answer: prove

exercise set 5.3
1. use mathemtical induction (and proof of proposition 5.3.1 as a model)
to show that any amount of money of at least 14cents can be made up using 3cent and 8cent coin


for every integer  n>=14, n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 8cent coin

let the property p(n) be the folowing:

n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 8cent coin

show that p(14) is true
p(14) is true because 14 cent can be obtained with one 8cent coin and 2x3 cent coin

show that for every integer k>=14, if p(k) is true, then p(k+1) is also true

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=14. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 14 such that

k cent can be obtained using 3c and 5c coin

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 cent can be obtained using 3c and 5c coints

case 1:
