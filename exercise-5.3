1. mathematicl induction differs from the kind of inductio used in natural sciences
because it's actually a form of ___ reasoning
answer: deductive


2. mathematical induction can be used to ___
conjectures that have been made using inductive reasoning
answer: prove

exercise set 5.3
1. use mathemtical induction (and proof of proposition 5.3.1 as a model)
to show that any amount of money of at least 14cents can be made up using 3cent and 8cent coin


for every integer  n>=14, n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 8cent coin

let the property p(n) be the folowing:

n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 8cent coin

show that p(14) is true
p(14) is true because 14 cent can be obtained with one 8cent coin and 2x3 cent coin

show that for every integer k>=14, if p(k) is true, then p(k+1) is also true

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=14. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 14 such that

k cent can be obtained using 3c and 8c coin

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 cent can be obtained using 3c and 8c coints
case 1:
there is a 8c coin among those used to make up the kc
in this case replace the 8c with 3x 3c coins to obtain (k+1)

case 2:
there is a not a 8c coin among those used to make up the kc)
since k>= 14 we must have at least 5x 3c coins
to obtain k+1 wen can replace 5x 3c coin with 2x 8c coin

[since k+1 is true for both cases in inductive step, therefore this is rue]


2. use mathematical induction to show that any postage of at least 12c
can be obtained using 3c and 7c coin

for every integer  n>=12, n cents can be obtained using 3cent and 7cent coin

let the property p(n) be the folowing:
n postage cents can be obtained using 3cent and 7cent stamps

show that p12 is true: it can be purchased with 4x 3c coin

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=12. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 12 such that

k postage cents can be obtained using 3cent and 7cent stamps

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 cent can be obtained using 3c and 7c coints
case 1:
there is a 7c coin among those used to make up the kc
??? how do i get to 7c+1?

case 2:
there is a not a 7c coin among those used to make up the kc
since k>= 12 we must have at least 4x 3c coins
to obtain k+1 wen can replace 2x 3c coin with 1x 7c coin

[since k+1 is true for both cases in inductive step, therefore this is rue]

3. stamps are sold in packages containing either 5 stamps or 8 stamps
a. show that a person can obtain 5,8,10,13,15,16,20,21,24, or 25 stamps by collection of 5 stamp packages
and 8 stamp packages

answer:
5 stamps: 1x 5s
8 stamps: 1x 8s
10 stamps: 2x 5s
13 stamps: 1x 5s + 1x 8s
15: 3x 5s
16: 2x 8s
20: 4x 5s
21: 2x 8s + 1x 5s
24: 3x 8s
25: 5x 5s

b. use mathematical induction to show that any quantity of at least 28 stamps can be obtained
by buying a collection of 5 stamp packages and 8 stamp packages


for every integer  n>=28, n stamps can be obtained by buying a collection of 5stamp and 8stamp packages

[suppose that p(k) is true for a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer k>=28. that is]
Suppose that k is any integer with k>= 28 such that

k stamps can be obtained by buying a collection of 5stamp and 8stamp packages

[we must show that p(k+1) is true] we must show that

k+1 stamps can be obtained by buying a collection of 5stamp and 8stamp packages

case 1:
there is a 8stamp package among those who make up the k stamp
???

case 2:
there is not 8stamps package among those who make up k stamp
since k >=28 there must be at least 6x 5stamp
to achieve k+1 we can replace 3x 5stamp with 2x 8stamp




4. for each positive integer n, let p(n) be the sentence
that describes the ollowing divisibility property

5^n - 1 is divisible by 4

a. write p(0), is p(0) true?
b. write p(k)
c. write p(k+1)
d. in a proof by mathematical induction that this divisibility property holds for every integer n>=0
what must be shown in the inductive step?
