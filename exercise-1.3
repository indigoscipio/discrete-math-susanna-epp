S = set of all strings over a
relation L from S to Znonneg as followes
for everystring s in S and every nonnegative integer n

(s,n) means that thhe length of s is n
then L is a function because every string in S has one an only one length

A = {x,y}
S = set all strings over A

12. relation C from S to S as follows
for all strings s and t in s
(s,t) E C means t = ys
then C is a function because every string in S consists entirely of X and Ys and adding an additional
y to the left of creates a single new string that ocnsists of x's andy's and is, therefore, also in X

yes, f = g since the inupt and output is the smae

20. define functions H and K from R to R by the following formulas
for every x E R,

does H = K?

H(-1) = (-1-2)^2 = 9
K(-1) = (-1-1)(-1-3) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9

K(0) = (0-1)(0-3) + 1 = -1 -3 + 1 = 4


H(1) = (1-2)^2 = 1
K(1) = (1-1)(1-3) + 1 = 1

Yes, H = K because the input and output is exactly hte same
