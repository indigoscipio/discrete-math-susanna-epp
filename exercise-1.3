1. given sets A and B, a relation from A to B is a cartesian product A x B if (a,b) is an element of R = A R B
2. a function F from A to B is a relation from A to B that satisfies the folowing two peroperties
a. for every element x of A, there can be only one associated element y of B where (x,y) is an element of F
b. for all elements x in A and y and z in B, if (x,y) is an element of F and (x,z) is also an eleement of F, then y  = z
c. if F is a function from A to b and x is an element of A, then F(x) is A x B
