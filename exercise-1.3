1. given sets A and B, a relation from A to B is a cartesian product A x B if (a,b) is an element of R = A R B
2. a function F from A to B is a relation from A to B that satisfies the folowing two peroperties
a. for every element x of A, there can be only one associated element y of B where (x,y) is an element of F
b. for all elements x in A and y and z in B, if (x,y) is an element of F and (x,z) is also an eleement of F, then y  = z
c. if F is a function from A to b and x is an element of A, then F(x) is A x B


Exercise set 1.3
1) A = {2,3,4} | B = {6,8,10}
define a relation R from A -> B as : for every ordered pair (x,y) E A x B,
(x,y) E R = y/x is an integer
a. is 4 R 6? 6 / 4 = 1.5 (false, not an integer)
is 4 r 8? 8 / 4 = 2 (true, an integer)
is (3,8) E R? 8 / 3 = 2.667 (false, not an integer therefore not an element of R)
is (2,10) E R? 10/2 = 5 (yes, it is an integer therefor an elemnt of R

6/2 = 3, 8/3 = 
b. Write R as a set of ordere paird
R = {(2,6),(2,8),(2,10),(3,6),(4,8)}

c. write te domain and codomain of R
domain R = {2,3}
codomain R = {6,8,10}

d. arrow diagram for r
2 -> 6
2 -> 8
2 -> 10
3 -> 6
3 -> 8

2) let C = D = {-3,--2,-1,1,2,3}
define a relation S from C to D
for eveyr (x,y) E C x D, (x,y) E S means that 1/x - 1/y is an integer
a. is 2 S 2? 1/2 - 1/2 = 0 (true, because part of an integer)
is -1 S -1 ? 1/-1 - 1/-1 = -1 - -1 = 0 (true, an integer)
is (3,3) E S? 1/3 - 1/3 = 0 (yes, also an integer)
is (3, -3) E S? 1/3 - (-1/3) = 1/6 (false, not an integer)

b. write S as a set of ordere pairs
S = {(),}
