========== Exercise set 3.4 ==========

1. Let the following law of algebra be the first state
ment of an argument: For all real numbers a and b,

(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

Suppose each of the following statements is, in 
turn, the second statement of the argument. Use 
universal instantiation or universal modus ponens 
to write the conclusion that follows in each case.

 a. a=x and b=y are particular real numbers.
(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2

 b. a=fi and b=fj are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with fi and b with fj
conclusion: (fi+fj)^2 = fi^2 + 2fifj + fj^2

 c. a=3u and b=5v are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with 3u and b with 5v
conclusion: (3u + 5v)^2 = 3u^2 + 2(3u+5v) + 5v^2

 d. a=g(r) and b=g(s) are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with g(r) and b with g(s)
conclusion: (g(r) + g(s))^2 = g(r)^2 + 2(g(r))+g(s)) + g(s)^2

 e. a=log(t1) and b=log(t2) are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with log(t1) and b with log(t2)

fill in valid conclusions for the arguments in 2–4.

19. Rewrite the statement “No good cars are cheap” 
in the form “Ax, if P(x) then ,Q(x).”
Indicate whether each of the following arguments is valid or invalid, and justify your answers.

E car x, x is a good AND x  is not cheap
A car x, x is a good -> x  is not cheap
P(x) = x is good
Q(x) = x is not cheap
Ax, P(x) -> Q(x)

a. 
p1: no good car is cheap P(x) -> Q(x)
p2: a rimbaud is a good car P(x)
c: a rimbaud is not cheap Q(x)
answer: this argument is valid because it follows modus tollens (P -> Q, P, then Q)

c. p1: no good car is cheap P(x) -> Q(x)
p2: a VX roadster is cheap ~Q(x)

answer: this argument is valid because it's a contrapositive of the original statement and has the logical equivalence

d. p1: no good car is cheap P(x) -> Q(x)
p2: an omnex is not a good car ~P(x)
conclusoin: an omnex is cheap ~Q(x)
answer: this argument is invalid because of inverse error


20. Use a diagram to show that the following 
argument can have true premises and a false conclusion.
 
 a. p1: all dogs are carnivorous
 p2: aaron is not a dog
 conclusion: aaron is not carnivorous

I'll try draw here in the simplest way
 O <- Carnivores
 O <- All dogs (inside carnivores)
 O <- Aaron (inside All Dogs), but still inside carnivores
 therefore the conclusion is false (aaron is carnivorous)

b. What can you conclude about the validity or 
invalidity of the following argument form? 
Explain how the result from part (a) leads to 
this conclusion.

p1: Ax, if P(x) then Q(x)
p2: ~P(a) for a particular a
conclusion: ~Q(a)
answer: this argument is invalid because of inverse error of the argument form
explanation: p1 has P(x) -> Q(x), but since p2 is ~P(a) and conclusion ~Q(a) it's error by inverse

Indicate whether the arguments in 21–27 are valid or 
invalid. Support your answers by drawing diagrams.
21.
p1: all people are mice
p2: all mice are mortal
c: all people are mortal
O <- All Mice
O <- All People (inside of All Mice)
O <- All Mortal
this is invalid since mortal does not have any children, theres no connection indicating people are mortal in the diargram

22. 
p1: all discrete math students can tell a valid argument from an invalid one
p2: all thoughtful people can tell a valid argument from an invalid one
c: all discrete math students are thgoughtful
A person x, x is a discrete math student, x can tell valid argument from an invalid one Px -> Rx
A person x, x is a thoughtful person, x can tell valid argument from an invalid one Qx -> Rx
Ax, x is a discrete math student -> x is thoughtful Px -> Qx
O <- All discrete math students P(x)
O <- All thoughtful people Q(x) - this circle is inside of P(x)
O <- CriticalThinking (Ability to tell valid argument from invalid one) R(x) - 2 items is inside this, px and qx
this is invalid because theres no indication of relations between P(x) and Q(x) even though they are subset of R(x)


23.
p1: all teachers occasionaly make mistakes
p2: no gods ever make mistakes
c: no teachers are gods
Ax, x is a teacher -> x make mistakes Px -> Qx
Ax, x is a god -> x does not make mistakes Rx -> ~Qx
Ax, x is a teacher -> x is not a god Px -> ~Rx
O <- all teachers (inside making a mistake)
O <- all gods (outside of making a mistake)
O <- making a mistake
conclusion is true since it's inside making mistake circle which is seperate from all gods circle

24.
p1: no vegetarians eat meat
p2: all vegans are vegetarians
p3: no vegans eat meat
Ax, x is a vegetarian, x does not eat meat
Ax, Vegetarian(x) -> DoesNotEatMeat(x)
Ax, x is a vegan, x is a vegetarian
Ax, Vegan(x) -> Vegetarian(x)
Ax, x is a vegan -> x does not eat meat
Ax, Vegan(x) -> DoesNotEatMeat(x)

O <- All Vegetarian (inside Does not eat meat)
O <- All Vegan (Inside vegetarian)
O <- Does Not Eat Meat
conclusion: statement is true because vegan is inside vegetarain which is inside doesnoteatmeat circle

25. 
p1: no college cafetaria food is good
p2: no good food is wasted
c: no college cafetaria food is wasted

Ax, x is college cafetaria food -> x is not good
Ax, CCF(x) -> NotGood(x)
Ax, x is good food -> x is not wasted
Ax, Good(x) -> NotWasted(x)
Ax, x is college cafetaria food -> x is not wasted
Ax, CCF(x) -> NotWasted(x)

O <- CollegeCafetariaFood (inside NotGoodFood)
O <- NotGoodFood
O <- GoodFood (inside NotWasted)
O <- NotWasted
conclusion is false because collegecafetariafood is not inside not wasted circle, and they are both seperate

26.
p1: all polynomial functions are differentiable 
p2: all diferentiable functions are continuous
c: all polynomial functions are continuous
Ax, Poly(x) -> Diff(x)
Ax, Diff(x) -> Cont(x)
Ax, Poly -> Con(x)
this is true because of transitivity form, no need to draw the diagram

27.
p1: nothing intelligeble ever puzzles me
p2: logic puzzles me
c: logic is iunintelligble
Ax, x is not intelliglbe, x does not puzzles me
Ax, ~Int(x) -> ~Puz(x)
Ax, x is logic, x puzzles me
Ax, Log(x) -> Puz(x)
Ax, x is logic, x is unintelligeble
Ax, Log(x) -> ~Int(x)

O <- All unintelligeble (inside does not puzzle me)
O <- Does not puzzle me
O <- Puzzles me
O <- All Logic (inside puzzles me)
this is false because All logic is inside puzzles me which si seperate from does not puzzle me circle

In exercises 28–32, reorder the premises in each of the 
arguments to show that the conclusion follows as a valid 
consequence from the premises. It may be helpful to 
rewrite the statements in if-then form and replace some 
of them by their contrapositives. exercises 28–30 refer to 
the kinds of tarski worlds discussed in examples 3.1.13
and 3.3.1. exercises 31 and 32 are adapted from Symbolic 
Logic by Lewis Carroll.*

if-then rewrite


 In 33 and 34 a single conclusion follows when all the given 
premises are taken into consideration, but it is difficult 
to see because the premises are jumbled up. reorder the 
premises to make it clear that a conclusion follows logi
cally, and state the valid conclusion that can be drawn. 
(It may be helpful to rewrite some of the statements in 
if-then form and to replace some statements by their 
contrapositives.)
