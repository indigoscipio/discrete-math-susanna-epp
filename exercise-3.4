1. The rule of universal instantiation says that if 
some property is true for ____ in a domain, then it is true for ____
answer: everything/all in a set, then it is true for any particular thing in the set


2. If the first two premises of universal modus 
ponens are written as “If x makes P(x) true, then 
x makes Q(x) true” and “For a particular value 
of a ____, then the conclusion can be written 
as _____
answer: P(a), Q(a)

lens are written as “If x makes P(x) true, then x 
makes Q(x) true” and “For a particular value of a
___ then the conclusion can be written as _____
answer: ~Q(a), ~P(a)


4. If the first two premises of universal transitivity are 
written as “Any x that makes P(x) true makes Q(x)

true,” then the conclusion can be written as 
_____
answer: P(x) -> R(x)

5. Diagrams can be helpful in testing an argument 
for validity. However, if some possible configu
rations of the premises are not drawn, a person 
could conclude that an argument was _____
it was actually _____
answer: valid, invalid

========== Exercise set 3.4 ==========

1. Let the following law of algebra be the first state
ment of an argument: For all real numbers a and b,

(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

Suppose each of the following statements is, in 
turn, the second statement of the argument. Use 
universal instantiation or universal modus ponens 
to write the conclusion that follows in each case.

 a. a=x and b=y are particular real numbers.
(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2

 b. a=fi and b=fj are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with fi and b with fj
conclusion: (fi+fj)^2 = fi^2 + 2fifj + fj^2

 c. a=3u and b=5v are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with 3u and b with 5v
conclusion: (3u + 5v)^2 = 3u^2 + 2(3u+5v) + 5v^2

 d. a=g(r) and b=g(s) are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with g(r) and b with g(s)
conclusion: (g(r) + g(s))^2 = g(r)^2 + 2(g(r))+g(s)) + g(s)^2

 e. a=log(t1) and b=log(t2) are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with log(t1) and b with log(t2)

Use universal instantiation or universal modus ponens to 
fill in valid conclusions for the arguments in 2–4.

2.
major premise: If an integer n equals 2k and k is an integer, then n is even. 
minor premise: 0 equals 2x0 and 0 is an integer.
conclusion: ???

answer: 0 is even

3. 
major premise:
for all real numbers a, b, c, and d,
if b does not equal 0 and d does not equal 0 then a/b + c/d = (ad+bc)/bd.

minor premise:
 a = 2, b = 3, c = 4, and d=5 5 are particular 
real numbers such that b does not equal 0 and d does not equal 0

conclusion:???
answer: a/b + c/d = (ad + bd)/bd

4.
Major premise: A(all) real number r,a, and b, if r ispositive, then (r^a)^b = r^ab
Minor premise: r = 3, a = 1/2, and b=6 are particular real numbers such that r is positive
conclusion:???
answer: (r^a)^b = r^ab

Use universal modus tollens to fill in valid conclusions for 
the arguments in 5 and 6.
5. 
Major premise: All irrational numbers are real nubmers
minor premise: 1/0 is not a real number
Conclusio: ??
answer: 1/0 is not irrational

6. 
Major premise: If a computer program is correct, then compilation of the program
does notproduce error messages
minor premise: compilation of this program produces error messages
Conclusio: ??
answer: this program is not correct

Some of the arguments in 7–18 are valid by universal 
modus ponens or universal modus tollens; others are 
invalid and exhibit the converse or the inverse error. State 
which are valid and which are invalid. Justify your answers

7.
major premise: All healthy people eat an apple a day
minor premise: keisha eats an apple a day
conclusion: keisha is a healthy person
p1: Ax person x, if x is healthy -> x eat an apple aday (P -> Q)
p2: Q
conclusion: P
P = x is healthy
Q = x eats an apple a day
is it valid?
No, it's invalid because of converse error

8.
major premise: All freshmen must take a writing course 
minor premise: caroline is a freshman
conclusion: caroline must take a writing course
Ax, x is a freshman -> x must take writing course (P -> Q)
P
Q
Yes, this is a valid argument

9.
major premise: If a graph has no edges, then it has a vertex of degree zero.
minor premise: This graph has at least one edge.
conclusion: This graph does not have a vertex of degree zero.
P -> Q
~P
~Q
This statement is false because of inverse error


10.
major premise:  If a product of two numbers is 0, then at least one of the numbers is 0.

conclusion: The product (2x+1)(x-7) is not 0.
P -> Q
~P
~Q
answer: this statement is false because of inverse error
