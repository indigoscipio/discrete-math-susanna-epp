1. The rule of universal instantiation says that if 
some property is true for ____ in a domain, then it is true for ____
answer: everything/all in a set, then it is true for any particular thing in the set


2. If the first two premises of universal modus 
ponens are written as “If x makes P(x) true, then 
x makes Q(x) true” and “For a particular value 
of a ____, then the conclusion can be written 
as _____
answer: P(a), Q(a)


3. If the first two premises of universal modus tol
lens are written as “If x makes P(x) true, then x 
makes Q(x) true” and “For a particular value of a
___ then the conclusion can be written as _____
answer: ~Q(a), ~P(a)


4. If the first two premises of universal transitivity are 
written as “Any x that makes P(x) true makes Q(x) 
true” and “Any x that makes Q(x) true makes R(x) 
true,” then the conclusion can be written as 
_____
answer: P(x) -> R(x)

5. Diagrams can be helpful in testing an argument 
for validity. However, if some possible configu
rations of the premises are not drawn, a person 
could conclude that an argument was _____
it was actually _____
answer: valid, invalid

========== Exercise set 3.4 ==========

1. Let the following law of algebra be the first state
ment of an argument: For all real numbers a and b,

(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

Suppose each of the following statements is, in 
turn, the second statement of the argument. Use 
universal instantiation or universal modus ponens 
to write the conclusion that follows in each case.

 a. a=x and b=y are particular real numbers.
(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2

 b. a=fi and b=fj are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with fi and b with fj
conclusion: (fi+fj)^2 = fi^2 + 2fifj + fj^2

 c. a=3u and b=5v are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with 3u and b with 5v
conclusion: (3u + 5v)^2 = 3u^2 + 2(3u+5v) + 5v^2

 d. a=g(r) and b=g(s) are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with g(r) and b with g(s)
conclusion: (g(r) + g(s))^2 = g(r)^2 + 2(g(r))+g(s)) + g(s)^2

 e. a=log(t1) and b=log(t2) are particular real numbers.
universal instantiation by substitute a with log(t1) and b with log(t2)

Use universal instantiation or universal modus ponens to 
fill in valid conclusions for the arguments in 2–4.

2.
major premise: If an integer n equals 2k and k is an integer, then n is even. 
minor premise: 0 equals 2x0 and 0 is an integer.
conclusion:
