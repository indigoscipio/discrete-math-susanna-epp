1) when the elements of a set are given using the set-roster notation, the order in which they are listed does not matter
2) symbol R denotes all real number
3) symbol Z denotes all integers
4) symbol Q denotes all rational numbers
5) the notation {x | P(x)} read the set of all x such that x p of x is true
6) for a set A to be a subset of set B means that all elements of A is contained in B
7) given sets A and B, the cartesian product A x B = the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where A is an element of A and b is an element of B	
8)given sets A, B, and C, the cartesian product A x B x C = the set of all ordered triples (a,b,c) where A is an element of A, b is an element of B, and C is an element of C
9) string length n over a set S is an order n-tuple of elements S, written witout bracket or parenthesis

exercise set 1.2
1) A = C, B = D
2) a. is the set of all positive real numbers x such that x is greater than 0 and less than 1
b. the set of all real numbers x such that x is less than or equal to 0 or x is greater than or equal to 1
c. the set of all integers n such that n is a factor of 6
d. the set of all positive integer n such that n is a factor of 6

3)a. is 4 = {4}? No, because number 4 does not equal to a set of 4
b. how many lements are in the set {3,4,3,5}? it contains 3 elements since similar repeats doesnt matter ina set
c. how many elements are in the set {1,{1},{1,{1}}} this one contains 3 elements 1, {1}, and {1,{1}}

4)a is 2 E (is an element of) {2}? The answer is yes
b. how manyelements are in the set {2,2,2,2}? 1.
c. how many elements are in the set {0, {0}} = 2 elements: 0 and {0}
d. is {0} E(is an element of) {{0},{1}}? yes, it is
e. is 0 E {{0},{1}}? No it is not

5)which of the following sets are equal?
A = {0,1,2}
B = {x E R | -1 <= x < 3} = {-1, 0, 1, 2} where theres infinitely number in between them
C = {x E R | -1 < x < 3} = {0,1,2} where theres infinite numbes in between since its real
D = {x E Z | -1 < x < 3} = {0,1,2}
E = {x E Z+ | -1 < x < 3} = {1,2}
In conclusion A = D

6) for each integern, let Tn = {n, n square}
how many elmeents are in each of T2, T-3, and T0?
T2 = {2, 2 square} = {2,4} = 2 elements
T-3 = {-3, -3 square} = {-3, 9} = 2 elements
T1 = {1, 1} = 1 element
T0 = {0, 0} = 1 element since its similar

7) use set roster notatino to indicate elements in each of the floowing sets
a. S = {0, -1, 1}
b. T = { 1, 0, 2}
c. U = {2, -1, 0,1,2}
d. V = {} empty
e. W = {-2,-1,0}
f. X = {4,3,2,1}

8) a = {c,d,f,g}
b = {f,j}
c = {d,g}
a. is B a subset of A? no because A does not contain all ements of B {f,j}
b. is C a subset of A? Yes because all elements of C is included in A
c. is C a subset of C? Yes, because it contains all elements of itself
d. is C a propoer subet of A? Yes, because A contains all elements of C and A does not equal C

9) a) is 3 an element of {1,2,3}? yes
b. is 1 a subet of {1}? no because 1 is a number
c. is {2} and lement of {1,2}? no because theres no {2} in that set
d. is {3} an element of {1,{2},{3}}? Yes
e. is 1 an element of {1}? yes
f. is {2} a subset of {1,{2},{3}}? No it is not because theres no 2 in that set
g. is {1} a subset of {1,2}? Yes
h. is 1 an element of {{1},2}? nope
i. Is {1} a subset of {1,{2}}? yes because theres 1 in that set
j. is {1} a subset of {1} yes

10.a. yes by definition of equality they are equal
b. no because 5 does not equal -5 so false
c. yes they are equal
d. not euqal
