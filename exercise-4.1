elementary number theory & methods of proof

Test yourslef.

1. an integer is even if, and only if ___
answer: it is twice some integer
2. an integer is odd if and only if ___
answer: it is twice some integer plus one
3. an intger is n if prime if and only If
answer: its greater than one, n is equal the product of any two positive integer
, then one of the integers equals 1 and the other equals n
4. the most common way to disprove a universal statement is to find ____
answer: a counterexample of the statement (at least one truth of the negation)
5. According to the method of generalizing from the 
generic particular, to show that every element of 
a set satisfies a certain property, suppose x is a 
_____, and show that _____.
answer: x is particular but arbitrarily chosen element of the set; picked and show that x is true
6. To use the method of direct proof to prove a state
ment of the form, “For every x in a set D, if P(x) 
then Q(x),” one supposes that _________ and one 
shows that ___________
answer: x is particular but arbirary chose element from d which makes te conclusion Q(x) is true.

Exercise set 4.1
In 1–4 justify your answers by using the definitions of 
even, odd, prime, and composite numbers.

note to self
even = 2m where m is integer
odd = 2n + 1 where n is integer
prime = n = r x s -> (r=1 or s=1 or r=n or s=n).

1. assume that k is a particular integer
a. is -17 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd (2n +1) where n is integer, we get the following
-17 = 2n + 1
(-17 -1) / 2 = n
-18/2 = n
n = 9

b. is 0 neither even nor odd?
by the definition of even = 2x where x is integer, odd = 2x + 1 where x is integer, we get the following
check for even -> 0 = 2x
x = 0/2
x = 0, since 0 is an integer, therfore 0 is even

check for odd -> 0 = 2x + 1
0 = 2x + 1
0-1/2 = x
x = -1/2, since x is not an integer, it is not odd

is 0 neither even nor odd? this means 0 is not even AND 0 is not odd?
since we know 0 is even AND 0 is NOT odd we get a false (false AND true = false)
therefore this is false

c. is 2k-1 odd?
we need to compare 2k-1 with 2k + 1 (which is the definition of odd)
We can rewrite this as 2(k + 1) - 1
let t = k + 1 where k is an integer
therefore its odd


2. assume that c is a particular integer
a. is -6c is an even integer?
by the definition of even: 2x where x is an integer
let c = 3
-6c= 2(-3c)
therefore it is an even integer since it it can be written as 2 x some integer and it's even


b. is 8c + 5 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd: 2n + 1 where n is an integer, we get the following:
2(4c+2) + 1
this still follows the odd number structure, therefore it's odd

c. is (c^2+1) - (c^2-1) -2 an even integer?
answer: by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we get the following:
c^2+1- c^2-1 - 2
0 = 0
0 can be rewriteen as 2(0), therefore the result is even.


3. assume that m and n are particular integers.
