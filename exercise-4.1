Exercise set 4.1
In 1–4 justify your answers by using the definitions of 
even, odd, prime, and composite numbers.

note to self
even = 2m where m is integer
odd = 2n + 1 where n is integer
prime = n = r x s -> (r=1 or s=1 or r=n or s=n).

1. assume that k is a particular integer
a. is -17 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd (2n +1) where n is integer, we get the following
-17 = 2n + 1
(-17 -1) / 2 = n
-18/2 = n
n = 9

b. is 0 neither even nor odd?
by the definition of even = 2x where x is integer, odd = 2x + 1 where x is integer, we get the following
check for even -> 0 = 2x
x = 0/2
x = 0, since 0 is an integer, therfore 0 is even

check for odd -> 0 = 2x + 1
0 = 2x + 1
0-1/2 = x
x = -1/2, since x is not an integer, it is not odd

is 0 neither even nor odd? this means 0 is not even AND 0 is not odd?
since we know 0 is even AND 0 is NOT odd we get a false (false AND true = false)
therefore this is false

c. is 2k-1 odd?
we need to compare 2k-1 with 2k + 1 (which is the definition of odd)
We can rewrite this as 2(k + 1) - 1
let t = k + 1 where k is an integer
therefore its odd


2. assume that c is a particular integer
a. is -6c is an even integer?
by the definition of even: 2x where x is an integer
let c = 3
-6c= 2(-3c)
therefore it is an even integer since it it can be written as 2 x some integer and it's even


b. is 8c + 5 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd: 2n + 1 where n is an integer, we get the following:
2(4c+2) + 1
this still follows the odd number structure, therefore it's odd

c. is (c^2+1) - (c^2-1) -2 an even integer?
answer: by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we get the following:
c^2+1- c^2-1 - 2
0 = 0
0 can be rewriteen as 2(0), therefore the result is even.


3. assume that m and n are particular integers.
a. is 6m+8n even?
by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we can get the following:
anwer: 2(3m+4n), which follows the even number form, therefore it is even

b. is 10mn + 7 odd?
answer: we can rewrite this as the definition of odd, which is 2n + 1 where n is an integer
2(5mn+6) + 1, since this follows the 2n+1 form, therefore it is odd/

c. if m > n > 0, is m^2 - n^2 composite?
a num is composite if it's n> 1, n = rxs for some integers r and s sch that 1 < r < n and 1 < s < need

m > n > 0 means that m and n must be greater than 0,
this is one of the definiton of  composite number has to be greater than 1

let m = 3 and n = 2
(3-2)(3+2)
1 x 5
= 5

let m = 4, n = 2
(4-2)(4+2)
2 x 6
12 - composite (2 x 6)

answer: 5 is a prime, therefore it is not always composite

4. assume that r and s are particular integers.
a. is 4rs even?
answer: yes, because it can be rewritten as 2(2rs)  (2n format)
b. is 6r + 4s^2 + 3 odd?
answer: yes, because it can be rewritten as 2(3r+2s^2+2) + 1 (2n + 1 format)
c. if r and s are both positive, is r^2 + 2rs + s^2 composite?
it's composite only if n is greater or equal than 2



prove the statements in 5 - 11
5. there are integers m and n such that m > 1 and n > 1 and 1/m + 1/n is an integer

1/m +1/n
m+n/mn = k
m+n = kmn


let m = 2
let n = 2
2+2/4 = 1 (an integer)

let m = 3
let n = 3
6/9 (not an integer)

let m = 4
let n = 4
8/16 (not an integer)

let m = 3
let n = 2
2+3/6 (not an integer)

6. there are a distinct integers m and n such that 1/m + 1/n is an integer
1/m + 1/n where m, n is an integer
let m = 1, n = -1
1/1 + 1/-1 = 1 (which is an integer)


7. there are real numbers a and b such that sqrt(a+b) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)
let a = 2, b = 2
sqrt(4) = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)
2 = 1.41 + 1.41 (false)

let a = 1, b = 1
sqrt(1) = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1)
1 = 1 + 1 (false)

proof:
square both sides 
a+b= a + (sqrt(a)+sqrt(b))^2 + b
0 = 2sqrt(ab)
ab = 0

8. there is an integer n > 5 such that 2^n-1 is prime
let n = 6
Is 2^6 - 1 prime? 63 is not prime (false)

let n = 7
Is 2^7 - 1  prime? 127 is prime (true)

let n = 8
Is 2^8 -1 prime? 255 is not prime

since 127 is prime, the statement is true

9. there is a real number x such that x > 1 and 2^x > x^10
let x = 2
2 > 1 (true)
2^2 > 2^10 (false) 

let x = 3
3 > 1 (true)
2^3 > 3^10 (false) 


let x = 100
100 works, therefore its true

10. there is a perfect square that can be written as the sum of two other perfect squares
Definition:  An integer n is called a perfect square if, and only if, n = k^2 for some integer k

n^2 = a^2 + b^2, where n is a perfect square and a,b is any integer
let a = 3, b = 4, n = 5
5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2
25 = 9 + 16
therefore it is true

11. there is an integer n such that 2n^2 - 5n + 2 is prime
let n = 1
2n^2 - 5n + 2
2 - 5 + 2 = -5 (not prime)

let n = 2
8 - 10 + 2 = 0 (not prime)

let n = 3
27 - 15 + 2
27 - 13 = 14 (not prime)

let n = 4
2.16 - 20 + 2
34 - 20 = 14 (not prime)

let n = 0
0 - 0 + 2 = 2 (prime)
therefore the statement is true

In 12–13, (a) write a negation for the given statement,  
and (b) use a counterexample to disprove the given state
ment. explain how the counterexample actually shows 
that the given statement is false.

12. for all real numbers a and b, if a < b then a^2  < b^2
a. negation of the given statement
rewrite: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, a < b -> a^2 < b^2
negation: Ex real number a, Ex real number b, a < b AND a^2 >= b^2

b. counterexample to disprove the given statement & explanation
a = b =  at least one real number
a < b AND a^2 >= b^2
let a = -1, b = 0
a < b = -1 < 0 (true)
1 >= 0 (true)
therefore the counterexample is true

13. for every integer n, if n is odd then (n-1)/2 is odd
a. negation of the given statement
rewrite: Ax integer n, n is odd -> (n-1)/2 is odd
negation: Ex integer n, n is odd AND (n-1)/2 is even

b. counterexample to disprove the given statement & explanation
n = at least one integer
let n = 1
1 is odd (true)
(n-1)/2 is even = 0/2 = 0 is even (true)
therefore the counterexample is true

Disprove each of the statements in 14–16 by giving a 
counterexample. In each case explain how the counterex
ample actually disproves the statement.

14. For all integers m and n, if 2m+n is odd then m and n are both odd
Ax integer m, Ax integer n, 2m+n is odd -> M is odd AND N is odd

Ex integer m, Ex integer n, 2m+n is odd AND (M is even OR N is even)
counterexample: we need to find a case where the conclusion is false (m or n is even)
let m = 0, n = 1
0 + 1 = odd (true)
0 or 1 is even (true, 0 is even)
therefore the counterexample disproves the statement


15. For every integer p, if p is prime then p^2-1 is even
Ax integer p, p is prime -> p^2-1 is even
Ex integer p, p is prime AND p^2-1 is odd

counterexample: we need to find at least an integer which is prime and p^2-1 is odd
let p = 2
is 2 prime? true
is p^2-1 odd? 4-3 = 1 = true
therefore the counterexample dissproves the statement


16. For every integer n, if n is even then n^2 + 1 is prime
Ax integer n, n is even -> n^2 + 1 is prime
Ex integer n, n is even AND n^2 + 1 is not prime

counterexample: we need to find at least one n where n is even and n^2 + 1 is not a prime
let n = 0
is n even? true
is n^2 + 1 not a prime? 0+1 = 1 = true
therefore the counterexample for n = 0 disproves the given statement

In 17–20, determine whether the property is true for all 
integers, true for no integers, or true for some integers 
and false for other integers. Justify your answers

17. (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2
a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = a^2 + b^2
2ab = 0
when is 2ab = 0 true?
when at least a or b is 0 or both is 0, but a and b cannot not be 0
therefore it's true if a or b is 0, and it's false for other cases when a or b is not 0

18. a/b + c/b = a+c/b+d
a/b + c/d = a+c / b+d
ad+cb/bd = a+c/b+d
let a = 1, b = 1, c=1, d=1
1+1/1 = 2/2
2 = 1 (not equal)

therefore its true for some integers and true for otheres


19. -a^n = (-a)^n
let a = 1, n = 1
1^1 = (-1)^1
1 = 1 (true)

let a = -1, n = 2
-(-1)^2 = (--1)^2
-1 = 1 (not true)
therefore the given statement is false for some integers and not always true

prove the statement in 21 and 22 by the method of exhaustion.
21. Every positive even integer less than 26 can be expressed as a sum of three of fewer perfect squares. 
(For instance, 10 = 1^2 + 3^2 and 16 = 4^2.)
2 = 1^2 + 1^2
4 = 2^2
6 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2
8 = 2^2 + 2^2
10 = 3^2 + 1^2
12 = 3^2 + 2^2
14 = 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2
16 = 4^2
18 = 3^2 + 3^2
20 = 4^2 + 2^2
22 = 4^2 + 2^2 + 1^2
24 = 4^2 + 2^2 + 2^2
since all is true, therefore the statement is true by method of exhaustion


22. for each integer n with 1 <= n <= 10, n^2 - n + 11 is a prime number
let n
1 = 1 - 1 + 11 = 11 
2 = 2 + 11 = 13
3 = 6 + 11 = 17
4 = 12 + 11 = 23
5 = 20 + 11 = 31
6 = 30 + 11 = 41
7 = 42 + 11 = 53
8 = 56 + 11 = 67
9 = 72 + 11 = 83
10 = 90 + 11 = 101
since all is true, therefore the statment is true by methjod of exhaustion


Each of the statements in 23–26 is true. For each, (a) 
rewrite the statement with the quantification implicit as 
If ___, then ___, and (b) write the first sentence of a proof
(the “starting point”) and the last sentence of a proof (the “conclusion to be shown”). 
Note that you do not need to understand the statements in order to be able to do these exercises.)

23. For every integer m, if m > 1 then 0 < 1/m < 1
a) rewrite if-then:
Ax integer m, if m > 1 -> 0 < 1/m < 1
If m is an integer greater than 1, then 0 < 1/m < 1

b) rewrite first sentence and last sentence of a proof:
let M be an integer such that m > 1
thus, we have shown that 0 < 1/m < 1, ocmpleting the proof

24. For every real number x, if x > 1 then x^2 > x
a) rewrite if-then
Ax real number x, if x > 1 -> x^2 > x
If x is a real number greater than 1, then its square is greater than the number itself

b) rewrite first & last sencence:
Let x be any integer such that x > 1
thus, we have shown that x^2 > x is true, completing the proof.

25. for all integers m and n, if mn = 1 then m = n = 1 or m = n = -1
a) rewrite if-then
Ax integer m, Ax integer n, if mn = 1 -> m = n = 1 or m = n = -1
If the product of two integer m and n is 1, then m = n = 1 or m = n = -1
b) rewrite first & last sentence
let m and n be an integer such that mn = 1
thus we have shown that m = n = 1 or m = n = -1 is true, completing the proof

26. For every real number x, if 0 < x < 1 then x^2 < x
a) rewrite if-then
Ax real number x, if 0 < x < 1 then x^2 < x
If a real number x is greater than 0 and less 1, then x^2 < x
b) rewrite first & last sentence
let x is a real number such that 0 < x < 1
thus we have shown that x^2 < x is true, comleting the proof


27. Fill in the blanks in the following proof.
theorem: for every odd integer n, n^2 is odd

proof: suppose n is any (a). by definition of odd, n = 2k+1 for some integer k then
n^2 = ((b))^2
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1
= 2(2k^2+2k) + 1

Now 2k^2+2k is an integer because it is a sum of 
products of integers. Therefore, n^2 equals 2?(an in
teger)+1, and so (c) is odd by definition of odd.

Because we have not assumed anything about n 
except that it is an odd integer, it follows from the 
principle of (d) that for every odd integer n, n^2 is odd.

answer:
a) odd integer
b) 2k+1
c) 2(2k^2+2k)+1
d) odd number

28.  In each of 28−31:

a. rewrite the theorem in three different ways:
as A____, if ____ then ____, 
as A____, ____ (without using the words if or then)
as if ____, then ___ (without using an explicit universal quantifier)

b. fill in the blanks in the proof of the theorem

theorem: the sum of any two odd integers is even
Proof: Suppose m and n are any [particular but 
arbitrarily chosen] odd integers. [We must show that m+n is even.]
by (a), m = 2r+1 and n = 2s + 1 for some integers r and s

then
m+n= (2r + 1) + (2s + 1) - by (b)
= 2r + 2s + 2
= 2(r+s+1) - by algebra

let u = r+s+1. then u is an integer because r, s and 1 are integers and because (c)
hence m+n 2u, where u is an integer and so, by (d), m+n is even [as was to be shown]

a) rewrite the theorem in 3 different ways
theorem: the sum of any two odd integers is even
1st form: A integer m and n, if m and n is odd, then m + n is even
2nd form: A intege m and n, m + n is even
3rd form: If any two integers are odd, its sum is even

b) fill in the blanks
blank a = the definition of odd
blank b = by substitution
blank c = the sum of all integers is an integer
blank d = the definition of even

29. theorem: the negative of any even integer is even
proof: suppose n is any [particular but arbitrarily chosen] even integer
[we must show that -n is even]

by (a), n = 2k for some integer k
then
-n = -(2k) - by (b)
= 2(-k) - by algebra

let r = -k. then r is an integer because -1 and k are integers and (c)
hence -n = 2r, where r is an integer, and so -n is even by (d) [as was to be shown]

a) rewrite the theorem in 3 different ways:
theorem: the negative of any even integer is even
1st form: A even integer n, if n is negative, then n is even
2nd form: A even integer n, its negative is even
3rd form: If an integer is even, then its negative is also even

b) fill in the blanks
blank a = the definition of even
blank b = by substitution
blank c = the product of two integers is an integer
blank d = thedefinition of even

30. theorem 4.1.2: the sum of any even integer and any odd integer is odd
proof: suppose m is any even integer and n is (a).
By the definition of even, m = 2r for some (b),
and by definition of odd, n = 2s + 1 for some integer s. by substitution and algebra,
m+n = (c) = 2(r+s)+1
since r and s are both integers, so is their sum r + s, hence m+n has the form twice some integer plus one,
and so (d) by definition of odd


a) rewrite the theorem in 3 different ways
theorem: The sum of any even integer and any odd integer is odd.
1st form: Ax integer m, Ax integer n, if m and n is an even, then its sum is odd
2nd form: Ax even integer m and n, its sum is odd
3rd form: 

b) fill in the blanks
blank a =  any odd integer
blank b =  integer r
blank c =  (2r) + (2s+1)
blank d =  2(r+s)+1 is odd

31. theorem: whenever n is an odd integer, 5n^2+7 is even
proof: suppose n is any [particular but arbitrarily chosen] odd integer
[we must show that 5n^2+7 is even]
by the definitino of odd, n = (a) for some integer k
then
5n^2 + 7 = (b) - by substitution
= 5(4k^2 + 4k + 1) + 7
= 20k^2 + 20k + 12
= 2(10^2 + 10k + 6) - by algebra

let t = (c). then t is an integer because products and sums of integers are integers
hence 5n+7=2t, where t is an integer, and thus (d) by the defition of even [as was to be shown]

a) rewrite theorem in 3 different ways
theorem: whenever n is an odd integer, 5n^2+7 is even
1st form: A integer n, if n is odd, then 5n^2+7 is even
2st form: A odd integer n, 5n^2+7 is even
3st form: If an integer is odd,  then 5n^2+7 is even

b) fill in the blanks
blank a = 2k + 1
blank b = 5((2k+1)^2) + 7
blank c = (10k^2 + 10k + 6)
blank d = 5n^2+7 is even
