Exercise set 4.1
In 1–4 justify your answers by using the definitions of 
even, odd, prime, and composite numbers.

note to self
even = 2m where m is integer
odd = 2n + 1 where n is integer
prime = n = r x s -> (r=1 or s=1 or r=n or s=n).

1. assume that k is a particular integer
a. is -17 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd (2n +1) where n is integer, we get the following
-17 = 2n + 1
(-17 -1) / 2 = n
-18/2 = n
n = 9

b. is 0 neither even nor odd?
by the definition of even = 2x where x is integer, odd = 2x + 1 where x is integer, we get the following
check for even -> 0 = 2x
x = 0/2
x = 0, since 0 is an integer, therfore 0 is even

check for odd -> 0 = 2x + 1
0 = 2x + 1
0-1/2 = x
x = -1/2, since x is not an integer, it is not odd

is 0 neither even nor odd? this means 0 is not even AND 0 is not odd?
since we know 0 is even AND 0 is NOT odd we get a false (false AND true = false)
therefore this is false

c. is 2k-1 odd?
we need to compare 2k-1 with 2k + 1 (which is the definition of odd)
We can rewrite this as 2(k + 1) - 1
let t = k + 1 where k is an integer
therefore its odd


2. assume that c is a particular integer
a. is -6c is an even integer?
by the definition of even: 2x where x is an integer
let c = 3
-6c= 2(-3c)
therefore it is an even integer since it it can be written as 2 x some integer and it's even


b. is 8c + 5 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd: 2n + 1 where n is an integer, we get the following:
2(4c+2) + 1
this still follows the odd number structure, therefore it's odd

c. is (c^2+1) - (c^2-1) -2 an even integer?
answer: by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we get the following:
c^2+1- c^2-1 - 2
0 = 0
0 can be rewriteen as 2(0), therefore the result is even.


3. assume that m and n are particular integers.
a. is 6m+8n even?
by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we can get the following:
anwer: 2(3m+4n), which follows the even number form, therefore it is even

b. is 10mn + 7 odd?
answer: we can rewrite this as the definition of odd, which is 2n + 1 where n is an integer
2(5mn+6) + 1, since this follows the 2n+1 form, therefore it is odd/

c. if m > n > 0, is m^2 - n^2 composite?
a num is composite if it's n> 1, n = rxs for some integers r and s sch that 1 < r < n and 1 < s < need

m > n > 0 means that m and n must be greater than 0,
this is one of the definiton of  composite number has to be greater than 1

let m = 3 and n = 2
(3-2)(3+2)
1 x 5
= 5

let m = 4, n = 2
(4-2)(4+2)
2 x 6
12 - composite (2 x 6)

answer: 5 is a prime, therefore it is not always composite

4. assume that r and s are particular integers.
a. is 4rs even?
answer: yes, because it can be rewritten as 2(2rs)  (2n format)
b. is 6r + 4s^2 + 3 odd?
answer: yes, because it can be rewritten as 2(3r+2s^2+2) + 1 (2n + 1 format)
c. if r and s are both positive, is r^2 + 2rs + s^2 composite?
it's composite only if n is greater or equal than 2



prove the statements in 5 - 11
5. there are integers m and n such that m > 1 and n > 1 and 1/m + 1/n is an integer

1/m +1/n
m+n/mn = k
m+n = kmn


let m = 2
let n = 2
2+2/4 = 1 (an integer)

let m = 3
let n = 3
6/9 (not an integer)

let m = 4
let n = 4
8/16 (not an integer)

let m = 3
let n = 2
2+3/6 (not an integer)

6. there are a distinct integers m and n such that 1/m + 1/n is an integer
1/m + 1/n where m, n is an integer
let m = 1, n = -1
1/1 + 1/-1 = 1 (which is an integer)


7. there are real numbers a and b such that sqrt(a+b) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)
let a = 2, b = 2
sqrt(4) = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)
2 = 1.41 + 1.41 (false)

let a = 1, b = 1
sqrt(1) = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1)
1 = 1 + 1 (false)

proof:
square both sides 
a+b= a + (sqrt(a)+sqrt(b))^2 + b
0 = 2sqrt(ab)
ab = 0

8. there is an integer n > 5 such that 2^n-1 is prime
let n = 6
Is 2^6 - 1 prime? 63 is not prime (false)

let n = 7
Is 2^7 - 1  prime? 127 is prime (true)

let n = 8
Is 2^8 -1 prime? 255 is not prime

since 127 is prime, the statement is true

9. there is a real number x such that x > 1 and 2^x > x^10
let x = 2
2 > 1 (true)
2^2 > 2^10 (false) 

let x = 3
3 > 1 (true)
2^3 > 3^10 (false) 


let x = 100
100 works, therefore its true

10. there is a perfect square that can be written as the sum of two other perfect squares
Definition:  An integer n is called a perfect square if, and only if, n = k^2 for some integer k

n^2 = a^2 + b^2, where n is a perfect square and a,b is any integer
let a = 3, b = 4, n = 5
5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2
25 = 9 + 16
therefore it is true

11. there is an integer n such that 2n^2 - 5n + 2 is prime
let n = 1
2n^2 - 5n + 2
2 - 5 + 2 = -5 (not prime)

let n = 2
8 - 10 + 2 = 0 (not prime)

let n = 3
27 - 15 + 2
27 - 13 = 14 (not prime)

let n = 4
2.16 - 20 + 2
34 - 20 = 14 (not prime)

let n = 0
0 - 0 + 2 = 2 (prime)
therefore the statement is true

In 12–13, (a) write a negation for the given statement,  
and (b) use a counterexample to disprove the given state
ment. explain how the counterexample actually shows 
that the given statement is false.

12. for all real numbers a and b, if a < b then a^2  < b^2
a. negation of the given statement
rewrite: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, a < b -> a^2 < b^2
negation: Ex real number a, Ex real number b, a < b AND a^2 >= b^2

b. counterexample to disprove the given statement & explanation
a = b =  at least one real number
a < b AND a^2 >= b^2
let a = -1, b = 0
a < b = -1 < 0 (true)
1 >= 0 (true)
therefore the counterexample is true

13. for every integer n, if n is odd then (n-1)/2 is odd
a. negation of the given statement
rewrite: Ax integer n, n is odd -> (n-1)/2 is odd
negation: Ex integer n, n is odd AND (n-1)/2 is even

b. counterexample to disprove the given statement & explanation
n = at least one integer
let n = 1
1 is odd (true)
(n-1)/2 is even = 0/2 = 0 is even (true)
therefore the counterexample is true

Disprove each of the statements in 14–16 by giving a 
counterexample. In each case explain how the counterex
ample actually disproves the statement.

14. For all integers m and n, if 2m+n is odd then m and n are both odd
Ax integer m, Ax integer n, 2m+n is odd -> M is odd AND N is odd

Ex integer m, Ex integer n, 2m+n is odd AND (M is even OR N is even)
counterexample: we need to find a case where the conclusion is false (m or n is even)
let m = 0, n = 1
0 + 1 = odd (true)
0 or 1 is even (true, 0 is even)
therefore the counterexample disproves the statement


15. For every integer p, if p is prime then p^2-1 is even


counterexample:
explanation how the counterexample disproves the statement: 

16. For every integer n, if n is even then n^2 + 1 is prime
counterexample:
explanation how the counterexample disproves the statement: 

In 17–20, determine whether the property is true for all 
integers, true for no integers, or true for some integers 
and false for other integers. Justify your answers
