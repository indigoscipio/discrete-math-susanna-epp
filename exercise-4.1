ment of the form, “For every x in a set D, if P(x) 
then Q(x),” one supposes that _________ and one 
shows that ___________
answer: x is particular but arbirary chose element from d which makes te conclusion Q(x) is true.

Exercise set 4.1
In 1–4 justify your answers by using the definitions of 
even, odd, prime, and composite numbers.

note to self
even = 2m where m is integer
odd = 2n + 1 where n is integer
prime = n = r x s -> (r=1 or s=1 or r=n or s=n).

1. assume that k is a particular integer
a. is -17 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd (2n +1) where n is integer, we get the following
-17 = 2n + 1
(-17 -1) / 2 = n
-18/2 = n
n = 9

b. is 0 neither even nor odd?
by the definition of even = 2x where x is integer, odd = 2x + 1 where x is integer, we get the following
check for even -> 0 = 2x
x = 0/2
x = 0, since 0 is an integer, therfore 0 is even

check for odd -> 0 = 2x + 1
0 = 2x + 1
0-1/2 = x
x = -1/2, since x is not an integer, it is not odd

is 0 neither even nor odd? this means 0 is not even AND 0 is not odd?
since we know 0 is even AND 0 is NOT odd we get a false (false AND true = false)
therefore this is false

c. is 2k-1 odd?
we need to compare 2k-1 with 2k + 1 (which is the definition of odd)
We can rewrite this as 2(k + 1) - 1
let t = k + 1 where k is an integer
therefore its odd


2. assume that c is a particular integer
a. is -6c is an even integer?
by the definition of even: 2x where x is an integer
let c = 3
-6c= 2(-3c)
therefore it is an even integer since it it can be written as 2 x some integer and it's even


b. is 8c + 5 an odd integer?
answer: by the definition of odd: 2n + 1 where n is an integer, we get the following:
2(4c+2) + 1
this still follows the odd number structure, therefore it's odd

c. is (c^2+1) - (c^2-1) -2 an even integer?
answer: by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we get the following:
c^2+1- c^2-1 - 2
0 = 0
0 can be rewriteen as 2(0), therefore the result is even.


3. assume that m and n are particular integers.
a. is 6m+8n even?
by the definition of even: 2n where n is an integer, we can get the following:
anwer: 2(3m+4n), which follows the even number form, therefore it is even

b. is 10mn + 7 odd?
answer: we can rewrite this as the definition of odd, which is 2n + 1 where n is an integer
2(5mn+6) + 1, since this follows the 2n+1 form, therefore it is odd/

c. if m > n > 0, is m^2 - n^2 composite?
a num is composite if it's n> 1, n = rxs for some integers r and s sch that 1 < r < n and 1 < s < need

m > n > 0 means that m and n must be greater than 0,
this is one of the definiton of  composite number has to be greater than 1

let m = 3 and n = 2
(3-2)(3+2)
1 x 5
= 5

let m = 4, n = 2
(4-2)(4+2)
2 x 6
12 - composite (2 x 6)

answer: 5 is a prime, therefore it is not always composite

4. assume that r and s are particular integers.
a. is 4rs even?
answer: yes, because it can be rewritten as 2(2rs)  (2n format)
b. is 6r + 4s^2 + 3 odd?
answer: yes, because it can be rewritten as 2(3r+2s^2+2) + 1 (2n + 1 format)
c. if r and s are both positive, is r^2 + 2rs + s^2 composite?
it's composite only if n is greater or equal than 2



prove the statements in 5 - 11
5. there are integers m and n such that m > 1 and n > 1 and 1/m + 1/n is an integer
6. there is a distinct integers m and n such that 1/m + 1/n is an integer
7. there are real numbers a and b such that sqrt(a+b) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)
