exercise set 2.1

In each of 1–4 represent the common form of each argu
ment using letters to stand for component sentences, and 
fill in the blanks so that the argument in part (b) has the 
same logical form as the argument in part (a).

1a. if all integers are rational then the number 1 is rational
all integers are rataional
therefore, number 1 is rational
P = all integers are rational
Q = number 1 is rational
b. if all algrebaic expression can be written in prefis notation, then
(a + 2b) (a^2 -b) is a algebraic expression
therefore (a + 2b) (a^2 -b) can be written in prefix notation

2a. if all computer programs contain errors, then this program contains an error
p = all computer programs contain error
q = this program contains an error
This program does not contain an error (~q)
Therefore, it is not the case that all computer programs contain error (~q)
b. if 2 is odd, then all prime numbers are odd
2 is not odd
therefore, it is not the case that all prime numbers are odd

3. ths number is even or this number is odd (p V q)
P = this number is even
q = this number is odd
this number is not even (~p)
therefore, this number is odd (q)

b. My mind is shot or logic is confusing
My mind is not shot
Therefore, logic is confusing

4. a. if a program syntax is faulty, then the computer will generate an error message
p = if a program syntax is faulty
q = the computer will generate an error message
p -> q
if the compter generates an error message, then the program will not run
q -> r
r = the program will not run
therefore, if the program syntax is faulty, then the program will not run

b. if this simple graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges, the it is complete.
if this graph is complete, then any two of its vertices can be joined by a path
therefore, if this simple graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges, then any two of its vertices can be joined by a path

5. Indicate which of the following sentences are statements.
;note : statements are sentecnes that only contain either false or true value, not both
a. 1024 is the smallest four digit number that is a perfect square - sqrt of 31 = less than 4 digits = true statement
b. she is a mathematics major  - not a statement
c. 128 = 2 ^ 6 = false statement
d. x = 2 ^ 6 - not a statement unless x is 64 then it's true


Write the statements in 6–9 in symbolic form using the 
symbols ,, ~, and ` and the indicated letters to represent 
component statements.
6. s = stocks are increasing
i = interest rates are steady
a. Stocks are increasing but interest rates are steady = a A(and) i
b. Neither are stocks increasing nor are interest rates steady. = (~s V i)

7. juan is a math major but not a computer sicence major
m = juan is a math major
c = juan is a computer science major
component statment symbolic form: m A ~c


8. h = john is healthy
w = john is wealthy
s = john is wize

a. john is healthy and wealthy but not wise
(h A w) A ~s
b. john is not walehty but he is healthy and wise
~w A (h A s)
c. john is neither healthy, wealthy, nor wise
(~h A ~w A ~s)
d. john is netiehr wealthy nor wise, but he is hearlhy
(~h A ~s) A has
e. john is wealthy, but is his not both healthy and wise
w A ~(h A s)

9. p = x > 5
q = x = 5
r = 10 > x
a. x >= 5
p V q
b. 10 > x > 5
r V p
c 10 > x >= 5
r V (p V q)

10. p = DATAENDFLAG is off
q = ERROR equal 0
r = SUM is less than 1000
express the following stneces in symbolic notation
a. DATAENDFLAG is off, ERROR equals 0, and SUM is less than 1,000
p A q A r
b. DATAENDFLAG is off but ERROR is not equal to 0.
p A ~q
c. DATAENDFLAG is off; however, ERROR is not 0 or SUM is greater than or equal to 1,000.
p A (~q V ~r)
d. DATAENDFLAG is on and ERROR equals 0 but SUM is greater than or equal to 1,000.
~p A q A ~r
e. Either DATAENDFLAG is on or it is the case that both ERROR equals 0 and SUM is less than 1,000.
p V (~q A r)

11. In the following sentence, is the word or used in 
its inclusive or exclusive sense? A team wins the 
playoffs if it wins two games in a row or a total of 
three games.

p = a team wins the playoff
q = it wins two games in a row or a total of 3 games
it is an exclusive sense. because
team wins two games in a row - this is a win guarantee
total of 3 games - team can still lose (eg lose 2 games)
so this is an either or situation / XOR

 Determine whether the statement forms in 16–24 are 
logically equivalent. In each case, construct a truth table 
and include a sentence justifying your answer. Your sen
tence should show that you understand the meaning of 
logical equivalence.

16.  p V (p A q) and p
p   q   (p A q)     p V (p A q)
T   T   T           T  
F   T   F           F
T   F   F           T
F   F   F           F
yes, they are logically equivalent

17. ~(p A q) and ~p A ~q
p   q   (p A q)     ~(p A q)    ~p  ~q  (~p A ~q)
T   T   T           F           F   F   F

F   F   F           T           T   T   T

therefore these two are not logically equivalent.  

18. p v t and t
p   t   p v t
T   T   T
F   T   T

yes, they are equal bescause anything or'ed with tautology is always true

19. p A t and p
p   t   p A t
T   T   T
F   T   F

Yes, they are both equal because when p is false and t is true, since this is an and its false

20. p A c and p V c
p   c   p A c   p V c
T   F   F       T
F   F   F       F

those two are not logically equivalent because p A c is always false where in p V c since this is or  theres one case that it's true

21. (p A q) A r and p A (q A r)
im gonna go ahead and say its equivalent here because there's a law that orders of parenthesis dont matter (dont remember te name of the law) but let me check

p   q   r   p A q   q A r   (p A q) A r     p A (q A r)
T   T   T   T       T       T               T

F   F   F   F       F       F               F
