test yourself
1. an and statement is true when, and only when both components are true
2. an or statemetn is false when and only when both components are false
3. two statement forms are logically equivalent when and only when they always have the same truth value
4. de morgans law say (1) the negation of an and statement is logically equivalent
to the or statement in which component is negated, and (2) that the negation of an or statement is logically
equivalent to the and statement in which each component isn negated
5. a tautology is a statement that is always true
6. a contradiction is a statement that is always false

exercise set 2.1

In each of 1–4 represent the common form of each argu
ment using letters to stand for component sentences, and 
fill in the blanks so that the argument in part (b) has the 
same logical form as the argument in part (a).

1a. if all integers are rational then the number 1 is rational
all integers are rataional
therefore, number 1 is rational
P = all integers are rational
Q = number 1 is rational
b. if all algrebaic expression can be written in prefis notation, then
(a + 2b) (a^2 -b) is a algebraic expression
therefore (a + 2b) (a^2 -b) can be written in prefix notation

2a. if all computer programs contain errors, then this program contains an error
p = all computer programs contain error
q = this program contains an error
This program does not contain an error (~q)
Therefore, it is not the case that all computer programs contain error (~q)
b. if 2 is odd, then all prime numbers are odd
2 is not odd
therefore, it is not the case that all prime numbers are odd

3. ths number is even or this number is odd (p V q)
P = this number is even
q = this number is odd
this number is not even (~p)
therefore, this number is odd (q)

b. My mind is shot or logic is confusing
My mind is not shot
Therefore, logic is confusing

4. a. if a program syntax is faulty, then the computer will generate an error message
p = if a program syntax is faulty
q = the computer will generate an error message
p -> q
if the compter generates an error message, then the program will not run
q -> r
r = the program will not run
therefore, if the program syntax is faulty, then the program will not run

b. if this simple graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges, the it is complete.
if this graph is complete, then any two of its vertices can be joined by a path
therefore, if this simple graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges, then any two of its vertices can be joined by a path

5. Indicate which of the following sentences are statements.
;note : statements are sentecnes that only contain either false or true value, not both
a. 1024 is the smallest four digit number that is a perfect square - sqrt of 31 = less than 4 digits = true statement
b. she is a mathematics major  - not a statement
c. 128 = 2 ^ 6 = false statement
d. x = 2 ^ 6 - not a statement unless x is 64 then it's true


Write the statements in 6–9 in symbolic form using the 
symbols ,, ~, and ` and the indicated letters to represent 
component statements.
6. s = stocks are increasing
i = interest rates are steady
a. Stocks are increasing but interest rates are steady = a A(and) i
b. Neither are stocks increasing nor are interest rates steady. = (~s V i)

7. juan is a math major but not a computer sicence major
m = juan is a math major
c = juan is a computer science major
component statment symbolic form: m A ~c
