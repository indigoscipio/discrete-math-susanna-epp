1. given any real number x, the floor of x is the unique integer n such that ___
answer: n <= x < n + 1

2. given any real number x, the ceiling of x is the unique integer n such that ___
answer: n - 1 < x <= n

compute floor(x) and ceil(x) for each values of x in 1 -4
floor(x) = ⌊ ⌋
ceil(x) = ⌈ ⌉

1. 37.9999
floor = 37
ceil = 38

2. 17/4 = 4.25
floor = 4, ceil = 5

3. -14.000001
floor = -15, ceil = -14

4. -32/5 = -6.4
floor = -7
ceil = -6

5. use the floor notation to express 259 div 11 and 259 mod 11

n div d = floor(n/d)
= floor(259/11) = floor(23.54545) = 23

n mod d = n - d . floor(n/d)
= 259 - 11 . floor(259/11)
= 259 - 11 . 23
= 259 - 253 = 6

6. if k is an integer, what is ceil(k)? why?
by the definition of ceiling, given any real number x, a ceiling of x can be written as
ceil(x) = n - 1 < x <= n where n is an integer

since k is already an integer, ceil(k) = k itself.

7. if k is an integer, what is ceil(k + 1/2)? why?
by the definition of ceiling, given any real number x, a ceiling of x can be written as
ceil(x) = n - 1 < x <= n where n is an integer

Since k + 1/2 is halfway between two integer, the smallest integer that's greater or equal to it is
k + 1/2 = k + 1

8. Seven pounds of raw material are needed to 
manufacture each unit of a certain product. 
Express the number of units that can be produced 
from n pounds of raw material using either the 
floor or the ceiling notation. Which notation is 
more appropriate?

lbs of raw material = n
answer: floor(n/7) because we need to count the number of complete product

9. Boxes, each capable of holding 36 units, are 
used to ship a product from the manufacturer to 
a wholesaler. Express the number of boxes that 
would be required to ship n units of the product 
using either the floor or the ceiling notation. 
Which notation is more appropriate?

36n
