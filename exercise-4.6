1. given any real number x, the floor of x is the unique integer n such that ___
answer: n <= x < n + 1

2. given any real number x, the ceiling of x is the unique integer n such that ___
answer: n - 1 < x <= n

compute floor(x) and ceil(x) for each values of x in 1 -4
floor(x) = ⌊ ⌋
ceil(x) = ⌈ ⌉

1. 37.9999
floor = 37
ceil = 38

2. 17/4 = 4.25
floor = 4, ceil = 5

3. -14.000001
floor = -15, ceil = -14

4. -32/5 = -6.4
floor = -7
ceil = -6

5. use the floor notation to express 259 div 11 and 259 mod 11

n div d = floor(n/d)
= floor(259/11) = floor(23.54545) = 23

n mod d = n - d . floor(n/d)
= 259 - 11 . floor(259/11)
= 259 - 11 . 23
= 259 - 253 = 6

6. if k is an integer, what is ceil(k)? why?
by the definition of ceiling, given any real number x, a ceiling of x can be written as
ceil(x) = n - 1 < x <= n where n is an integer

since k is already an integer, ceil(k) = k itself.

7. if k is an integer, what is ceil(k + 1/2)? why?
by the definition of ceiling, given any real number x, a ceiling of x can be written as
ceil(x) = n - 1 < x <= n where n is an integer

Since k + 1/2 is halfway between two integer, the smallest integer that's greater or equal to it is
k + 1/2 = k + 1

8. Seven pounds of raw material are needed to 
manufacture each unit of a certain product. 
Express the number of units that can be produced 
from n pounds of raw material using either the 
floor or the ceiling notation. Which notation is 
more appropriate?

lbs of raw material = n
answer: floor(n/7) because we need to count the number of complete product

9. Boxes, each capable of holding 36 units, are 
used to ship a product from the manufacturer to 
a wholesaler. Express the number of boxes that 
would be required to ship n units of the product 
using either the floor or the ceiling notation. 
Which notation is more appropriate?

say we have 100 unit
100 / 36 = 2.77778 which holds only 2 boxes max, with .7778 leftover
floor(2.7778) = 2
ceil(2.7778) = 3
which one is more appropriate?
since we have the leftover we need the ceiling to the leftover can be included even thorugh it doesn't package the full capacity

10. if 0 = sunday
1 = monday
2= tuesday, ..., 6 = saturday
then jan 1 of  year n occurs on the day of the week given by the following formula:

(n + (n - 1 / 4) - (n - 1 / 100) + (n - 1 / 400)) mod 7

a. use this formula to find january 1 of
i) 2050
= (2050 + (2049 / 4) - (2049 / 100) + (2049 / 400)) mod 7
= (2050 + 512.25 - 20.49 + 5.1125) mod 7
= 2546.8725 mod 7
= 2547 mod 7 = 6 (saturday)

ii) 2100
= (2100 + (2100 / 4) - (2100 / 100) + (2100 / 400)) mod 7
= (2100 + 525 - 21 + 5.25) mod 7
= 2609.25 mod 7
= 2609 mod 7 = 5 (Friday)

iii) 1997
= (1997 + (1997 / 4) - (1997 / 100) + (1997 / 400)) mod 7
= (1997 + 499.25 - 19.97 + 4.9925) mod 7
= 2481.2725 mod 7
= 2481 mod 7 = 3 (Wednesday)

b. intrepret the different components of this formula
n = the year were trying to compute
(n - 1 / 4) -> im guessing this is because leap year occurs every 4 years?
(n - 1 / 100) -> i have no idea what this is, maybe like the week?
(n - 1 / 400) -> maybe the day?


11. state a necessary and sufficient condition for the floor of a real number to equal that number

12. let S be the statement: For any odd integer n, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2
then s is true, but the following proof is incorrect. find the mistake

proof: suppose n is any odd integer, then n = 2k+k for some integer k
consequently,

floor(2k+1/2) = (2k+1) - 1 / 2 = 2k/2 = k

but n = 2k + 1. solving for k gives k = (n-1)/2.
hence by substitution, floor(n/2) = (n-1/2)

answer:

floor (2k + 1 / 2) should have evaluated to floor(k+1/2) instead of substituting the definition of odd integer
then evaluate last


13. prove that if n is any even integer, then floor(n/2) = n/2
by the definition of even, a number is even if it can be written as 2k where k is an integer
by the definition of floor, the floor of a number n can be written as n <= x < n + 1

n/2 = 2k/2 = k
applying the floor function floor(n/2) we get n/2 since n/2 is already an integer

[as was to be shown]

14.  show that the following statement is false
for all real numbers x and y, floor(x - y) = floor(x) - floor(y)

counterexample
x = 1.5, y = 0.6

floor(1.5 - 0.6) = floor(1.5) - floor(0.6)
floor(0) = floor(1) - floor(0)
0 = 1

Some of the statements in 15–22 are true and some are 
false. prove each true statement and find a counterexam
ple for each false statement, but do not use theorem 4.6.1 
in your proofs.
Theorem 4.6.1
 For every real number x and every integer m, floor(x+m) = floor(x) + m

 15. for every real number x, floor(x-1) = floor(x) - 1
by the definition of floor, given any real number x, floor(x) can be written as
unique integer n such that n <= x < n + 1
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x < n + 1

substitute 1 from the inqeuality
n - 1 <= x - 1 < n

floor(x-1) = n - 1
but we know from the first definition that  floor(x) = n
then we can substitute floor(x-1) = floor(x) - 1
[as was to be shown]

16. for every real number x, floor(x^2) = floor(x)^2
let x = 1.5

the statement is false
counterexample: x = 1.5
floor(1.5^2) = floor(2.25) = 2
floor(1.5)^2 = floor(1)^2 = 1^2 = 1
[as was to be shown]

17. for every integer n,

floor(n/3) = 
a. n/3 if n mod 3 = 0
b. (n-1) /3 is n mod 3 = 1
c. (n - 2 )/3 if n mod 3 = 2

using generalization

case 1: n mod 3 = 0
By the quotient reminder theorem, n mod 3 = 3 . q + r where q is an integer and 0 <= r < 3
since n mod 3 = 0, the reminder r = 0, thus n = 3q + 0 = 3q

Now compute n/3
n/3 = 3q/3 = q, since q is an integer, the floor function does nothing.
floor(n/3) = floor(q) = q, but n/3 = q so we have floor(n/3) = n/3


case 2: n mod 3 = 1
same as previous, n mod 3 = 1 , the reminder r =1 thus n = 3q + 1

n/3 = 3q+1/3 = q + 1/3. Since the floor function removes 1/3 this leaves: q
now compute n-1/3 = (3q + 1)-1/3 = 3q/3 = q

therefore floor(n/3) = n-1/3

case 3: n mod 3 = 2
n mod 3 = 2, the reminder r = 2 thus 3q + 2 by the quotient reminder theorem

first compute n/3
n/3 = 3q+2/3 = q + 2/3.
Now apply the floor function to n/3. Since the floor function removes 2/3 this leaves only q

Second compute right hand side, n-2/3
n-2/3 = 3q+2-2/3 = 3q/3 = q

Compare both sides
floor(n/3) = (n-2)/3

For all three cases, the statement holds
[as was to be shown]


since all of the values are true, therefore the statemnt is true [was was to be shown]

18. for all real numbers x and y, ceil(x + y) = ceil(x) + ceil(y)
let x = 1.2, y = 1.2

ceil(1.2+1.2) = ceil(1.2) + ceil(1.2)
3 = 2 + 2

since we found a counterexample, the statmeent is false

19. for every real number x, ceil(x-1) = ceil(x) - 1
let x = 1.2

ceil(0.2) = ceil(1.2) - 1
1 = 2-1

let x = 1.5
1 = 1

seems to be true, but we need to make a generalized proof
by the definition of ceiling, the ceiling of a real number n can be written as
n-1 < x <= n for some integer n

then we can subtract by 1
n - 2 < x - 1 <= n - 1

then by the definition of ceiling, ceil(x-1) = n - 1
Since we assumed earlier that ceil(x) = n, then we can substitute

ceil(x-1) = ceil(x) - 1 [as was to be shown]

20. for all real numbers x and y, ceil(xy) = ceil(x) . ceil(y)
let x = 1.5, y = 1.6

ceil(2.4) = ceil(1.5) . ceil(1.6)
3 = 2 . 2
3 = 4

since we found a counterexample, therefore the statement is false [QED]

21. for every odd integer n, ceil(n/2) = (n+1)/2

let n = 3
ceil(1.5) = 4/2
2 = 2

let n = -3
ceil(-1.5) = -2/2
-1 = -1

seems to be correct, so lets write a general proof
by the definition of odd, a number is odd if it can be written as 2k+1 for some integer k
by the definition of ceiling, the ceiling of a real number n can be written as
ceil(x) = n if only if n-1 < x <= n for some integer n

ceil(n/2) = ceil(2k+1/2) = ceil(k + 1/2)
we know from the definition that the ceiling of k + 1/2 is simply k + 1

now move to n+1/2
2k+1+1/2 = 2k+2 / 2 = k + 1

we have shown that floor(n/2) = k + 1 = n+1/2 [as was to be shown]

22. for all real numbers x and y, ceil(xy) = ceil(x) . floor(y)

let x = 1.5
let y = 1.5
ceil(2.25) = 2 . 1
2 = 2

let x = 1.5
let y = -1.5
ceil(-2.25) = 2 . -2
2 = -4

since we foudn a counterexample therefore the statement is false

prove each statements in 23-33
23. for any real number x, if x is not an integer, then floor(x) + floor(-x) = -1
by the definitoin of floor, the floor of a real number x can be written as
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x <= n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

floor(x) + floor(-x) = -1
x = n + r where n is an integer and 0 < r < 1

floor(x) = n
-x = -n-r
eg -2.3 = -2 -0.3
here x lies between -n <= -x < -n-1
n + (=n-1) = -1


24. for any integer m and any real number x, if x is not an integer, then floor(x) + floor(m-x) = m-1
integer m and real number x

floor(x) + floor(m-x) = m - 1

by the definitoin of floor, the floor of a real number x can be written as
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x <= n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

floor(x) = n
x = n + r where n is an integer and 0 < r < 1(since x is not an integer)

floor(m - x)
(m-x) = m - (n + r) = (m-n) + r
(m-n)-1 <= m - x < m-n

25. for any real number x, floor(floor(x/2)/2) = floor(x/4)
by the definitoin of floor, the floor of a real number x can be written as
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x <= n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

n <= x/2 < n + 1
n/2 <= (x/2)/2 < (n + 1)/2
n/2 = x/4 < n+1/2

floor(n/2)
k <= n/2 <= k + 1

threfore k <= x/4

second compute floor(floor(x/2)/2)
since we know floor(x/2) = n we can substitute
floor(n/2)

26. for every real number x, if x - floor(x) < 1/2 then floor(2x) = 2.floor(x)
by the definitoin of floor, the floor of a real number x can be written as
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x <= n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

x - floor(x)
floor(x) = n

= x - n < 1/2
= n <= x < n + 1/2
= 2n <= 2x <= 2n + 1

floor(2x) = 2n
but 2n = 2. floor(x) since n = floor(x)
[QEDs]


27.for every real number x, if x - floor(x) >= 1/2 then floor(2x) = 2.floor(x)+1
by the definitoin of floor, the floor of a real number x can be written as
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x <= n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege


floor(x) = n
= x - n >= 1/2
= x >= n + 1/2

n + 1/2 <= x < n + 1

floor(2x) = 2n + 1
2n + 1 < 2x < 2n + 2


28. for any odd integer n, floor(n^2/4) = (n-1/2) . (n+1/2)
by the definition of odd, an number is odd if it can be written as n = 2k + 1 for some integer k
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x <= n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

floor(n^2/4) = (n-1/2) . (n+1/2)
floor((2k+1)^2/4)
=floor((2k+1).(2k+1)/4)
=floor(4k^2 + 2k + 2k + 1 / 4)
=floor(4k^2 + 4k + 1 / 4)
=floor(k^2+k+1/4)

now apply the floor function to k^2+k+1/4
floor eliminates all fractional part less than 1
= k^2 + k

now evaluate the right hand side
(n-1/2) . (n-1/2)
=(2k+1-1/2) . (2k+1+1/2)
=2k/2 . 2k+2/2
= k . k + 1
= k^2 + k

since the left hand side and right hand side is equal, we have shown that it's proven
[QED]

29. for any odd integer n, ceil(n^2/4) = (n^2+3) /4
by the definition of odd, an number is odd if it can be written as n = 2k + 1 for some integer k
By the definition of ceiling, the ceiling of real number x can be written as n
ceil(x) = n if only if n-1 < x <= n where n is an integer

ceil(n^2/4) = (n^2 + 3) / 4
first lets evaluate the left hand side
(2k+1)^2/4
= (2k + 1) (2k + 1) / 4
= 4k^2 + 2k + 2k + 1 / 4
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 / 4
= k^2 + k + 1/4

now apply the ceiling function
since 1/4 is a fractional part it will be 1 since ceiling will push it to the next biggest integer
= k^2 + k + 1

now evaluate the right hand side
(n^2 + 3)/4
= (2k+1)^2 + 3 / 4
= 2k+1 . 2k+1 + 3 / 4
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 3 / 4
= 4k^2 + 4k + 4 / 4
= k^2 + k + 1

since the left and right hand side is eeuql, we have proven that the statement is true [QED]


30. for every integer n, floor(n/2) + ceil(n/2) = n
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x < n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

case 1: n is even (n = 2k)
first lets evaluate floor(n/2)
floor(2k/2) = k
ceil(2k/2) = k

floor(2k/2) + ceil (2k/2) = k + k = 2k = n

case 2: n is odd (n = 2k + 1)
floor(2k+1/2) = k + 1/2
floor(2k+1/2) = k
ceil(2k+1/2) = k+1

floor(2k+1/2) + ceil(2k+1/2) = k + k+ 1 = 2k + 1 = n

since the two cases equals n, thus we have proven the statement
[as was to be shown]

31. for every integer n, floor(floor(n/2)/3) = floor(n/6)
floor(x) = n if and only if n <= x < n + 1 where x is real number and n is an intege

case 1: n is even (n = 2k)
first lets evaluate floor(n/2)
floor(n/2) = floor(2k/2) = k

second evaluate floor(floor(n/2)/3)
floor(k/3) = floor(n/6)

floor(k/3) = floor(2k/6)
floor(k/3) = floor(k/3)

case 2: n is odd
floor(n/2) = floor(2k+1/2) = floor(k+1/2) = k
second evaluate floor(floor(n/2)/3)
floor(k/3) = floor(n/6)
floor(k/3) = floor(2k+1/6)
floor(k/3) = floor(k/3 + 1/6)

subcase a: k = 3q where r = 0
floor(k/3) = floor(k/3 + 1/6)
floor(3q/3) = floor(3q/3 + 1/6)
floor(q) = floor(q + 1/6)
q = floor(q + 1/6)
since 1/6 is the fractional part  therefore floor(q + 1/6) is q which is the smallest integer
q = q

subcase b: k = 3q + 1 where r = 1
floor(k/3) = floor(k/3 + 1/6)
floor(3q+1/3) = floor(3q+1/3 + 1/6)
floor(q+1/3) = floor(q+1/3 + 1/6)
floor(q+1/3) = floor(q+1/2)
q + floor(1/3) = q + floor(1/2)
q + 0 = q + 0


subcase c: k = 3q + 2 where r = 2
floor(k/3) = floor(k/3 + 1/6)
floor(3q+2/3) = floor(3q+2/3 + 1/6)
floor(q+2/3) = floor(q+5/6)
q + floor(2/3) = q + floor(5/6)
q + 0 = q + 0


32. for every integer n, ceil(ceil(n/2)/3) = ceil(n/6)

case 1: n is even (n = 2k)
ceil(n/2) = ceil(2k/2) = k
ceil(k/3) = ceil(n/6)
ceil(k/3) = ceil(2k/6)
ceil(k/3) = ceil(k/3)

case 2: n is odd (n = 2k + 1)
ceil(n)

33. A necessary and sufficient condition for an integer 
n to be divisible by a nonzero integer d is that 
n = floor(n/d) . d. In other words, for every integer n 
and nonzero integer d,
 a. if d | n, then n = floor(n / d) . d.
 b. if n = floor(n / d) . d, then d | necessary
