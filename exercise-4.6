1. given any real number x, the floor of x is the unique integer n such that ___
answer: n <= x < n + 1

2. given any real number x, the ceiling of x is the unique integer n such that ___
answer: n - 1 < x <= n

compute floor(x) and ceil(x) for each values of x in 1 -4
floor(x) = ⌊ ⌋
ceil(x) = ⌈ ⌉

1. 37.9999
floor = 37
ceil = 38

2. 17/4 = 4.25
floor = 4, ceil = 5

3. -14.000001
floor = -15, ceil = -14

4. -32/5 = -6.4
floor = -7
ceil = -6

5. use the floor notation to express 259 div 11 and 259 mod 11

n div d = floor(n/d)
= floor(259/11) = floor(23.54545) = 23

n mod d = n - d . floor(n/d)
= 259 - 11 . floor(259/11)
= 259 - 11 . 23
= 259 - 253 = 6

6. if k is an integer, what is ceil(k)? why?
by the definition of ceiling, given any real number x, a ceiling of x can be written as
ceil(x) = n - 1 < x <= n where n is an integer

since k is already an integer, ceil(k) = k itself.

7. if k is an integer, what is ceil(k + 1/2)? why?
by the definition of ceiling, given any real number x, a ceiling of x can be written as
ceil(x) = n - 1 < x <= n where n is an integer

Since k + 1/2 is halfway between two integer, the smallest integer that's greater or equal to it is
k + 1/2 = k + 1

8. Seven pounds of raw material are needed to 
manufacture each unit of a certain product. 
Express the number of units that can be produced 
from n pounds of raw material using either the 
floor or the ceiling notation. Which notation is 
more appropriate?

lbs of raw material = n
answer: floor(n/7) because we need to count the number of complete product

9. Boxes, each capable of holding 36 units, are 
used to ship a product from the manufacturer to 
a wholesaler. Express the number of boxes that 
would be required to ship n units of the product 
using either the floor or the ceiling notation. 
Which notation is more appropriate?

say we have 100 unit
100 / 36 = 2.77778 which holds only 2 boxes max, with .7778 leftover
floor(2.7778) = 2
ceil(2.7778) = 3
which one is more appropriate?
since we have the leftover we need the ceiling to the leftover can be included even thorugh it doesn't package the full capacity

10. if 0 = sunday
1 = monday
2= tuesday, ..., 6 = saturday
then jan 1 of  year n occurs on the day of the week given by the following formula:

(n + (n - 1 / 4) - (n - 1 / 100) + (n - 1 / 400)) mod 7

a. use this formula to find january 1 of
i) 2050
= (2050 + (2049 / 4) - (2049 / 100) + (2049 / 400)) mod 7
= (2050 + 512.25 - 20.49 + 5.1125) mod 7
= 2546.8725 mod 7
= 2547 mod 7 = 6 (saturday)

ii) 2100
= (2100 + (2100 / 4) - (2100 / 100) + (2100 / 400)) mod 7
= (2100 + 525 - 21 + 5.25) mod 7
= 2609.25 mod 7
= 2609 mod 7 = 5 (Friday)

iii) 1997
= (1997 + (1997 / 4) - (1997 / 100) + (1997 / 400)) mod 7
= (1997 + 499.25 - 19.97 + 4.9925) mod 7
= 2481.2725 mod 7
= 2481 mod 7 = 3 (Wednesday)

b. intrepret the different components of this formula
(n - 1 / 4) -> im guessing this is the month?
(n - 1 / 100) -> i have no idea what this is, maybe like the week?
(n - 1 / 400) -> maybe the day?

11. state a necessary and sufficient condition for the floor of a real number to equal that number

12.
