1. A second-order linear homogeneous recurrence 
relation with constant coefficients is a recur
rence relation of the form ___ for every integer 
k >= ___, where  ___
answer:  ak = Aak-1 + Bak-2 , 2, b are does not equal 0

2. given a recurrence realtion of form ak = Ak-1 + Bak-2 for every integer k>=2
the characterstic equation of the relations is___
answer: r^2 - At - B = 0

3. if a sequence a1, a2, a3 ... is deined by second-order lienar homogeneous recurrence relation
with constant coefficients and the characteristic equation for the relation has two distinct roots r 
and s (which could be complex numbers), then the sequence is given by an explicit formula of the 
form ____
answer: an = Cr^n + Ds^n

4. if a sequence a1, a2, a3, ...  is defined by a second
order linear homogeneous recurrence relation with 
constant coefficients and the characteristic equa
tion for the relation has only a single root r, then 
the sequence is given by an explicit formula of the 
form ___
answer: an = Cr^n + Dnr^n

Exercise set 2.8
1. which of the following are second order linear homogenuous recurrence relations with
constant coeffieicnt?
a. ak = 2ak-1 - 5ak-2
answer: true
b. bk = kbk-1 + bk-2
answer: false (kbk-1) contains k
c. ck = 3ck-1 . ck^2k-2
answer: false, contains c and ^2 on the 2nd one
d. dk = 3dk-1 + dk-2
answer: true
e. rk = rk-1 + rk-2 - 2
answer: false (2 at the end)
f. sk = 10sk-2
answer: true

2. which of the following are second order linear homogenuous recurrence relations with
constant coeffieicnt?
a. ak = (k-1)ak-1 + 2kak-2
answer: false, because of  (k-1) and 2k coeffieicnt
b. bk = -bk-1 + 7bk-2
answer: true
c. ck-1 + 1
answer: false (no 2nd recurrence relation)
d. dk = 3d^2k-1 + dk-2
answer: false (because of the 3d^2k)
e. rk = rk-1 - 6rk-3
answer: false, because jump from k-1 to k-3
f. sk = sk-1 + 10sk-2
answr: true

3. let a0, a1, a2, ... be the sequence defined by the explicit formula
an = c . 2^n + d for every integer n>= 0
where c and d are areal numbers

a. find c & d so that a0 = 1 and a1 = 3.
what is a2 in this case?
answer: 
a0 = 1
a0 = c . 2^0 + d
a0 = c . 1 + d = c + d

a1 = 3
a1 = c . 2^1 + d
a1 = c . 2 + d
a1 = 2c + d

2c + d - c + d = 3 - 1
2c + d - d = 2
c = 2

1 = 2 + d
d = -1

a2 = c . 2^2 + d
a2 = 2 . 4 - 1
a2 = 7

b. find c & d so that a0 = 0 and a1 = 2.
what is a2 in this case?
