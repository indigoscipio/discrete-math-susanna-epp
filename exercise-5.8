3. let a0, a1, a2, ... be the sequence defined by the explicit formula
an = c . 2^n + d for every integer n>= 0
where c and d are areal numbers

a. find c & d so that a0 = 1 and a1 = 3.
what is a2 in this case?
answer: 
a0 = 1
a0 = c . 2^0 + d
a0 = c . 1 + d = c + d

a1 = 3
a1 = c . 2^1 + d
a1 = c . 2 + d
a1 = 2c + d

2c + d - c + d = 3 - 1
2c + d - d = 2
c = 2

1 = 2 + d
d = -1

a2 = c . 2^2 + d
a2 = 2 . 4 - 1
a2 = 7

b. find c & d so that a0 = 0 and a1 = 2.
what is a2 in this case?
answer:
a0 = 0
0 = c . 2^n + d 
0 = c . 2^0 + d
0 = c . 1 + d
0 = c + d

a1 = 2
2 =  c . 2^1 + d
2 = 2c + d

subtract equation 1 from  equation 2
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 2 - 0
2c + d - c - d = 2
c = 2

substitute back c
0 = 2 + d
d = -2

now find a2
a2 = c . 2^2 + d
a2 = 2 . 2^2 - 2
a2 = 2 . 4 - 2
a2 = 6

4. let b0, b1, b2, ... be the sequence defined by the explicit formula
bn = c . 3^n + d(-2)^n for every integer n>= 0
where c and d are areal numbers
a. find c and d so that b0 = 0 and b1 = 5. 
what is b2 in this case?
answer:
0 =  c . 3^0 + d(-2)^0
0 = c . 1 + d . 1
0 = c + d

b1 = 5
5 = c . 3^1 + d(-2)^1
5 = 3c - 2d

c = -d
5 = 3.-d - 2d
5 = -3d - 2d
5 = -5d
d = -1

now find c
0 = c - 1
c = 1

b2 = 1 . 3^2 + -1(-2)^2
b2 = 9 + -1 . 4
b2 = 9 - 4
b2 = 5

b. find c and d so that b0 = 3 and b1 = 4.
what is b2 in this case?
b0 = 3
3 = c . 3^0 + d(-2)^0
3 = c + d

b1 = 4
4 = c . 3^1 + d(-2)^1
4 = 3c - 2d

now find c
3 = c + d
c = 3 - d

find d
4 = 3c - 2d
4 = 3(3 - d) - 2d
4 = 9 - 3d - 2d
4 = 9 - 5d
4 - 9 = -5d
-5 = -5d
d = 1

find c back
c = 3 - 1
c = 2

now find b2
b2 = c . 3^2 + d(-2)^2
b2 = 2 . 9 + -2^2
b2 = 18 + 4
b2 = 22

5. let a0, a2, ... be the sequence defined by the explicit formula

an = a . 2^n + d for each integer n>= 0
where c and d are real numbers. show that for any choice of c and d,

ak = 3ak-1 - 2ak-2 for every integer k>=2

answer:
ak = c  . 2^k + d

ak-1 = c . 2^k-1 + d

ak-2 = c . 2^k-2 + d

now substitute into the recurrence relation

3ak-1 - 2ak-2
3(c . 2^k-1 + d) - 2(c . 2^k-2 + d)
= (3c . 2^k-1 + 3d) - (2c . 2^k-2 -2d)
= (3c . 2^k-1 - 2c . 2^k-2) + (3d - 2d)
= c (3 . 2^k-1 - 2 . 2^k-2) + (3d - 2d)
= c (3 . 2^k-2 . 2 - 2 . 2^k-2) + (3d - 2d)
= c (6 . 2^k-2 - 2 . 2^k-2 ) + d
= c (2^k-2 (6 - 2) ) + d
= c . 2^k-2 . 4 + d
= c . 2^2 . 2^k-2 + d
= c . 2^k + d

 
6. let b0, b1, b2, ... be the sequence defined by the explicit formula

bn = c . 3^n + d(-2)^n for each integer n>= 0
where c and d are real numbers. show that for any choice of c and d,

bk = bk-1 + 6bk-2 for every integer k>=2

answer:
bk = c . 3^k + d(-2)^k
bk-1 = c . 3^k-1 + d(-2)^k-1
bk-2 = c . 3^k-2 + d(-2)^k-2

now substitute into the recurrence relation
bk = bk-1 + 6bk-2
bk = (c . 3^k-1 + d(-2)^k-1) + 6(c . 3^k-2 + d(-2)^k-2)
= c . 3^k-1 + d(-2)^k-1 + 6c . 3^k-2 + 6d (-2)^k-2
= c.3^k-1 + 6c . 3^k-2 + d(-2)^k-1 + 6d . (-2)k^2
= c (3^k-1 + 6.3^k-2) + d ((-2)^k-1 + 6(-2)^k-2)
= c (3.3^k-2 + 6.3^k-2) + d (-2 . (-2)^k-2 + 6 . (-2)^k-2)
= c (9 . 3^k-2) + d (4 . (-2)^k-2)
= c (3^2 . 3^k-2) + d (-2^2 . (-2)^k-2)
= c (3^k) + d (-2^k)

8. In each of 8â€“10: (a) suppose a sequence of the form  
1, t, t2, t3, ... , tn ... where t does not equal 0, satisfies the given recur
rence relation (but not necessarily the initial conditions), 
and find all possible values of t: (b) suppose a sequence sat
isfies the given initial conditions as well as the recurrence 
relation, and find an explicit formula for the sequence.

8. ak = 2ak-1 + 3ak-2 for every integer k>=2 
a0 = 1, a1 = 2

answer:
substitute into recurrence relation
ak = tk
tk = 2t^k-1 + 3t^k-2, lowest power is k-2
t^2 = -3 + -4
t^2 = 2t + 3

multiply = -3
add = -2
-3 and 1, so quadratic can be factored as
(t - 3)(t + 1) = 0

1st: t - 3 = 0
t = 3

2nd: t + 1 = 0
t = -1

9. bk = 7bk-1 - 10bk-2 for every intger k>=2
b0 = 2, b1 = 2
