One to one
no two inputs share the same ouput

onto (surjective)
range = codomain, no output is miseed

example 7.2.4
a. f is not onto
g is onto 

=======

Log and exponent

expt = how many steps does it take to do something?

b^x = how much quantity do i have after x steps of growth by factor b?

log = how long does it take to get there?

lg base b (x) = how much time does it take to reach quantity x using growth factor b?

===========================

test yourself
1. if f is a function from a set x to a set y,
then f is one to one if, and only if, ___
answer: for every input in x it produces one unique output in y/ every item in x
does not produce multiple ouptuts in y. no two distinct inputs in x product the same output in Y

2. if f is a function from from a setx to a set y, then f is not one to one if and only if __
answer: there is an input in x that produces multiple output in y
they share the same output

3. if f is a function from a set x to a set y, then f is onto
if and only if ___
answer: all outputs in y must come from some input from x (all output range must be covered)

4. if f is a function from a set x to a set y, then f is not onto
if and only if ___
answer: there is an output in y that does not come from input x (some output in y is not covered)

5. the following two statements are ___
Au , v E U, if H(u) = H(v) then u = v
Au, v E U, if u does not equal v then H(u) does not equal H(v)
answer: the definition of one on one


6. gieven a fcunti onf : x -> y where x is an infinite set
to prove that f is one to one you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: x1 and x2 are elements of x such that f(x1) = f(x2),
show that x1 = x2. in other words show outputs are the same, then show inputs the same

7. gieven a fcunti onf : x -> y where x is an infinite set
to prove that f is onto you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: y is any element of Y, show that there is an element x in X with f(x) = y

8. given a function f: x -> y, to prove that f is not one to one, you __
suppose x1 and x2 are leementx of x such that f(x1) = f(x2),
then you show that x1 does not equal.

9. given a function f: x -> y, to prove that f is not onto, you ___
answer: find element y in Y such that y does not equal f(x) for any x in X

10. a one to one correspondence from a set x to a set y is a __ that is __
answer: both one on one and onto

11. if f is a one to one correspondence from a set x to a set y and y is in Y, then f^-1 if
 a one to one corresepondnce from set Y to set X
