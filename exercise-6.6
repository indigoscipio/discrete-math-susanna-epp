One to one
no two inputs share the same ouput

onto (surjective)
range = codomain, no output is miseed

example 7.2.4
a. f is not onto
g is onto 

=======

Log and exponent

expt = how many steps does it take to do something?

b^x = how much quantity do i have after x steps of growth by factor b?

log = how long does it take to get there?

lg base b (x) = how much time does it take to reach quantity x using growth factor b?

===========================

test yourself
1. if f is a function from a set x to a set y,
then f is one to one if, and only if, ___
answer: for every input in x it produces one unique output in y/ every item in x
does not produce multiple ouptuts in y. no two distinct inputs in x product the same output in Y

2. if f is a function from from a setx to a set y, then f is not one to one if and only if __
answer: there is an input in x that produces multiple output in y
they share the same output

3. if f is a function from a set x to a set y, then f is onto
if and only if ___
answer: all outputs in y must come from some input from x (all output range must be covered)

4. if f is a function from a set x to a set y, then f is not onto
if and only if ___
answer: there is an output in y that does not come from input x (some output in y is not covered)

5. the following two statements are ___
Au , v E U, if H(u) = H(v) then u = v
Au, v E U, if u does not equal v then H(u) does not equal H(v)
answer: the definition of one on one


6. gieven a fcunti onf : x -> y where x is an infinite set
to prove that f is one to one you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: x1 and x2 are elements of x such that f(x1) = f(x2),
show that x1 = x2. in other words show outputs are the same, then show inputs the same

7. gieven a fcunti onf : x -> y where x is an infinite set
to prove that f is onto you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: y is any element of Y, show that there is an element x in X with f(x) = y

8. given a function f: x -> y, to prove that f is not one to one, you __
suppose x1 and x2 are leementx of x such that f(x1) = f(x2),
then you show that x1 does not equal.

9. given a function f: x -> y, to prove that f is not onto, you ___
answer: find element y in Y such that y does not equal f(x) for any x in X

10. a one to one correspondence from a set x to a set y is a __ that is __
answer: both one on one and onto

11. if f is a one to one correspondence from a set x to a set y and y is in Y, then f^-1 if
 a one to one corresepondnce from set Y to set X 

Exercise set 7.2
1. the definition of one to one is stated in two ways:
A x1, x2 E X, if F(x1) = F(x2) then x = x2
and A x1, x2 E X if x1 does not equal x2 then F(x1) does not equal f(x2)

why are these two logically equivalent?
answer:
in the first one:
for all x1, x2 (the inputs) in x, if those 2 input produces the same output through the function,
then two the inputs must be equal.

in the 2nd one:
 for all x1, x2 (the inputs), if these inputs are not equal, the the output must not be equal

it's the same because the second one is the negation and swap (contrapositive) of the 1st statement

2. fill in the blank with the word most or least
a. a function f is one to one if and only if, each element
in the codomain of f is the image of at ___ most element in the domain f
b. a function f is onto if and only if, each elementin the codomain f is the image of at ___
one element in the domain of f

answer:
a. one to one every input needs to produce one unique output at most,
and there can be no more than 1 output for every input
so the answer is most 

b. onto every output needs to be covered/ no gap
so the answer is at least

3. when saked to state the definition of one to one, a student replies
"a function f is one to one if and only if
 every element of x is sent by f to exactly one element of y"

 give counterexample to show that the student reply is incorrect

answer:
sent by f = image of / result of
exactly one element of y - what if theres two different input that produce same ouptut?
a function is not one to one if two different inputs map to the same output

coutnerexxample: F(x) = x^2
x1 = 2, x2 = -2

4. let f: x -> y be a function
true or false? a sufficient condition for f to be one to one is that
for every elmeent y in y, there is atm ost one x in X
with f(x) = y. explain your answer

sufficient = enough to guarantee outcome
p -> q 

for every output there is at most one input in x

definition of one to one is that every input needs to produce one unique output at most.
No single output y can be hit by two different arrows from x.
yes the definition is correct
