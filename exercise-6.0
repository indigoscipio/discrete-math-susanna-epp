Exercise set 6.1
1. in each of a - f , answer the following questions:
- is A C (is a subset of) B?
- is B C (is a subset of) A ?
- is either A or B a proper subset of the other?

a. A = {2,{2},sqrt(2)^2}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {2, {2}}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

is A C B ? true because all elements in A is within B, that is the number 2 and set {2}
is B C A ? false because the set A doesn't contain {{2}}
is A is a proper subset of B ? yes becuase A is a subset of B but B has extra element (A does not equal B)
is B is a proper subset of A ? no beacuse B is not a subset of A

b. A = {3, sqrt(5^2-4^2),24mod7}
B = {8mod5}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {3}
B = {3}

is A C B ? true because number 3 is in B
is B C A ? true because number 3 is in A
is A is a proper subset of B ? false even though A is a subset of B, A = B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false even though B is a subset of A, B = A

c. A = {{1,2},{2,3}}
B = {1,2,3}
answer:
is A C B ? no because set B doesn't contain {1,2} and {2,3}
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain the numbers 1, 2, 3
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because set A is not a subest of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because set B is not a subset of A

d. A = {a,b,c}
B = {{a},{b},{c}}
answer:
is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't contain a,b,c
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain {a}, {b} , {c}
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because B is not a subset of A

e. A = {sqrt(16),{4}}
B = {4}
answer:
after evaluation
A = {4,{4}}
B = {4}

is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't have {4}
is B C A ? yes because 4 is included in set A
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? yes because B is a subset of A and set B does not equal to set A

f. A = {x E (is an element of ) R | cos x E Z}
B = {x E R | sin x E Z}

answer:
after evaluation

is A C B ? fals ebecause all elements in A is not withint B
is B C A ? false  because all elements in A is not withint B
is A is a proper subset of B ? false because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false because B is not a subset of A

2. complete the proof from example 6.1.3.
prove that B is a subset of A where

A = {m E Z | m = 2a for some integer a} and 
B = {n E Z | n = 2b-2 for some integer b}

answer: 
suppose X is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
[we must show that x E A. by definition of A, this means we must show that x = 2 . some integer]

by definition of B, there is an integer b such that x = 2b - 2
this can be factored as x = 2(b - 1)
which has the form 2 some integer

thus by definition x is an element of A
[as to be shown]

3. let sets R, S, and T be defined as follows:
R = {x E Z | X is divisible by 2}
S = {y E Z | y is divisible by 3}
T = {z E Z | z is divisible by 6}

prove or disprove each of the following statements
a. R C (is a subset of) T
answer:

we need to find one element in R that is not in T
the number 4 is in set R but it's not in set t
therefore we found a counterexample

b. T C R

disprove attempt
find one element in T not in R
it seems a number divisibel by 2 is also divisble by 2

proof attempt
lets pick an arbitrary element x from set T
by the definition of T, x is divisible by 6 -> x = 6k for some integer k

but by definition of R, an integer is divisble by 2 -> 2 . some integer

since we know 2 is a factor of 6 we can rewrite 2(3 . some integer)
which fits the definiton of R

therefore proven

c. T C S

disprove attempt
find one element in T that's not in S
it seems a number divisible by 6 is also divisible by 3

proof attempt
lets pick an arbitrary element x from set T
by the definition of T, x is divisble by 6, we can write this as x = 6k for some integer k
then we can refactor x = 3(2k). since 2k is an integer we know
this fits the definiton of S which is 3 . some integer
threfore proven

4. let A = {n E Z | n = 5r for some integer r}
let B = {m E Z | m = 20s for some integer s}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of ) B
answer:


we need to find an element in A that is not in B
we need to find an element that's a multiple of 5 but not a multiple of 20
counterexample: the number 5

5 is in set A but not in set B
therefore proven

b. B C A
answer:

disproof attempt
we need to find an element in B that's not in A
that is, we need to find integer multiple of 20 but not a multiple of 5
this is impossible because all multiple of 20 always have a factor of 5.


proof attempt:
suppose x is a particular but arbitraryly chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 5r for some integer r
by the defintion of B, we know that x = 20s for some integer s

step 2: show that x is also in A
we can rewrite this to fit A's definition
x = 5(4s) for some integer s
since 4s is an integer, this fits the definition of A
thus proven


5. let C = {n E Z | n = 6r-5 for some integer r}
let D = {m E Z | m = 3s+1 for some integer s}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. C C (is a subset of ) D
answer:

proof attempt:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of C
we must show that x is an element of D, we must show that x = 3s + 1 for some integer s

by the definition of C, we know that x = 6r-5 for some integer r
6r - 5 = 6r - 6 + 1
factor out the 6
3(2r-2) + 1
since 2r-2 is an integer (lets call it s)
we show that 3s+1 is true
therefore this fits the definition of D
proven


b. D C C
answer:

proof attempt:
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of D
we must show that x is an element of C, we must show that x = 6r-5 for some integer r

step 2:
show that x is also in C
6r-5 = ???

doesn't seem right, lets try to disprove it
pick 1 elment in D ->


3(-2)+1 = -5
3(-1)+1 = -2
3(0)+1 = 1
3(1)+1 = 4
3(2)+1 = 7
3(3)+1 = 10
3(4)+1 = 13

6(-1)-5 = -11
6(0)-5 = -5
6(1)-5 = 1
6(2)-5 = 7
6(3)-5 = 13

therefore 4 is a counterexample

6. let A = {x E Z | x = 5a+2 for some integer a}
let B = {y E Z | y = 10b-3 for some integer b}
let C = {z E Z | y = 10c+7 for some integer c}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of) B
answer:
a = 1 -> 5(1)+2 = 7
a = 2 -> 5(2)+2 = 12
a = 3 -> 5(3)+2 = 17
b = 1 -> 10(1)-3 = 7
b = 2 -> 10(2)-3 = 17
b = 3 -> 10(3)-3 = 27

therefore 12 is not in set B
coutnerexample found


b. B C (is a subset of) A
answer:
disprove attempt
b = 1 -> 10(1)-3 = 7
b = 2 -> 10(2)-3 = 17
b = 3 -> 10(3)-3 = 27
a = 1 -> 5(1)+2 = 7
a = 2 -> 5(2)+2 = 12
a = 3 -> 5(3)+2 = 17
a = 4 -> 5(4)+2 = 22
a = 4 -> 5(5)+2 = 27
seems like a true statement

proof attempt
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 5a+2 some integer a

step 2:
show that x is also in A
by the definition of B, x = 10b - 3
x = ... + 2
x = 10b - 5 + 2
x = 5(2b - 1) + 2
since 2b-1 is an integer, lets fcall it a
therefore 5a + 2 fits the definition of A
therefore proven

c. B = C
answer:
disprove attempt

b = 1 -> 10(1)-3 = 7
b = 2 -> 10(2)-3 = 17
b = 3 -> 10(3)-3 = 27

c = 1 -> 10(1)+7 = 17
c = 2 -> 10(2)+7 = 27
c = 3 -> 10(3)+7 = 37
not sure, lets try to prove it

prove attempt
first we need to prove
B C (is a subset of) C

step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of C, we must show that x = 10c+7 some integer c

step 2:
show that x is also in C
by the definition of B, x = 10b - 3
x = ... +  7
x = 10b - 10 + 7
x = 10(b - 1) + 7
since b-1 is an integer (lets call it c), therefore this fits the definition of C
therfore B is a subset of C

secondly, we need to prove
C C (is a subset of) B

step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of C
we must show that x is an element of B, we must show that x = 10b - 3 some integer b

step 2:
show that x is also in B
by the definition of C, x = 10c + 7
then
x = ... - 3
x = 10c + 10 - 3
x = 10(c + 1) - 3
since c + 1 is an integer (lets call it b)
then this fits the deifnition of B

therefore both proven

7.  let A = {x E Z | x = 6a+4 for some integer a}
let B = {y E Z | y = 18b-2 for some integer b}
let C = {z E Z | z = 18c+16 for some integer c}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of) B
disprove attempt
a = -1 -> x = 6(-1)+4 = -2
a = 0 -> x = 6(0)+4 = 4
a = 1 -> x = 6(1)+4 = 10
a = 2 -> x = 6(2)+4 = 16
a = 3 -> x = 6(3)+4 = 22
a = 4 -> x = 6(4)+4 = 28
a = 5 -> x = 6(5)+4 = 34

b = 0 -> y = 18(0)-2 = -2
b = 1 -> y = 18(1)-2 = 16
b = 2 -> y = 18(2)-2 = 34
b = 3 -> y = 18(3)-2 = 52

counterexample is 10 because 10 is in set A but not in B

b. B C (is a subset of) A
answer:
we need to find an element in B that's not in A
seems to be true from calculation in a), but i'm not sure
proof attempt

step 1
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 6a + 4 some integer a

step 2:
by the definition of B, x = 18b-2
x = ... + 4
x = 18b - 6 + 4
x = 6(3b - 1) + 4
since 3b - 1 is an integer (lets call it a), therefore we have 6a + 4
this fits the definition of A threfore provn

c. B = C
to prove this we need to show two things:
B is a subset of C
and C is a subset of B

case 1: we need to show that B is  a subset of C

b = 0 -> y = 18(0)-2 = -2
b = 1 -> y = 18(1)-2 = 16
b = 2 -> y = 18(2)-2 = 34
b = 3 -> y = 18(3)-2 = 52

c = 0 -> y = 18(0)+16 = 16
c = 0 -> y = 18(1)+16 = 34
c = 0 -> y = 18(2)+16 = 52
c = 0 -> y = 18(3)+16 = 70

seems to be true, lets go with a general proof
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of C, we must show that x = 18c+16 some integer c


step 2:
by the definition of B, x = 18b-2
x = ... +16
x = 18b - 18 + 16
x = 18(b - 1) + 16
since b-1 is an integer, lets call it c, therefore this fits the definition of C

case 2, we need to prove C is a subset of B
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of C
we must show that x is an element of B, we must show that x = 18b-2 some integer b

by the definition of C, x = 18c+16
x = ... - 2
x = 18c + 18 - 2
x = 18(c + 1) - 2
since c+1 is an integer, lets call it b, therefore this fits the definition of B

since both cases aretrue therefore proven

symbol: A^c

9. complete the folowing sentences without using the symbols U(union), A(intersect), or -(difference)
a. x E(slash) A U B, if and only if ____
answer: a union b means x is either in a or b, so what makes x is not in this set is
its outside of a or b. so x is not an element of a and x is not an element of B

b. x E(slash) A A B, if and only if ____
answer: a intersect b means x has to be in both a and b. so what makes x is not in this set is
the negation of that, so x is not in A or x is not in B

c. x E(slash) A - B, if and only if ____
answer: a - b means x is in A but it's not in B. so what makes x not in this set is the negation of that.
so x is not in a or x is in b

10. let A = {1,3,5,7,9}

11. Let the universal set be R, the set of all real 
numbers, and let
A = {x E R | 0 < x <= 2}
B = {x E R | 1 <= x < 4}
C = {x E R | 3 <= x < 9}
find each of the following:

a. A U B
answer: {x E R | 0 < x < 4}

b. A A B
intersect so we need to find most common
answer: {x E R | 1 <= x <= 2}

c. A^c
answer:
complement of A means everyhing but A
the negation of (0,2] which means from 0 to minus infinity, and 2 up to infinity
{x E R | x <= 0 or x > 2 }

d. A U C
answer: A union C means its in either a or c
{x E R | 0 < x <= 2 or 3 <= x < 9}

e. A A C
answer: A intersect C means x has to be in both A and C
A = (0,2]
C = [3,9)
it's the empty set since theres nothing in common

f. B^c
answer: complement of B means x is in everything but B
since B is [1,4), then the complement is
{x E R | x < 1 or x >= 4}

g. A^c A B^c
answer: intersect of a complement and b complement
first we need to eval a complement and b complement, then intersect the two sets
start with a complement. this means x is in everything but A
we know that the set A = (0,2], then its complmeent is
A^c = {x E R | x <= 0 or x > 2}

we know from previous exercise B complement is the following
B^c = {x E R | x < 1 or x >= 4}

then we can find the intersect of both setes
