Exercise set 6.1
1. in each of a - f , answer the following questions:
- is A C (is a subset of) B?
- is B C (is a subset of) A ?
- is either A or B a proper subset of the other?

a. A = {2,{2},sqrt(2)^2}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {2, {2}}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

is A C B ? true because all elements in A is within B, that is the number 2 and set {2}
is B C A ? false because the set A doesn't contain {{2}}
is A is a proper subset of B ? yes becuase A is a subset of B but B has extra element (A does not equal B)
is B is a proper subset of A ? no beacuse B is not a subset of A

b. A = {3, sqrt(5^2-4^2),24mod7}
B = {8mod5}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {3}
B = {3}

is A C B ? true because number 3 is in B
is B C A ? true because number 3 is in A
is A is a proper subset of B ? false even though A is a subset of B, A = B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false even though B is a subset of A, B = A

c. A = {{1,2},{2,3}}
B = {1,2,3}
answer:
is A C B ? no because set B doesn't contain {1,2} and {2,3}
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain the numbers 1, 2, 3
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because set A is not a subest of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because set B is not a subset of A

d. A = {a,b,c}
B = {{a},{b},{c}}
answer:
is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't contain a,b,c
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain {a}, {b} , {c}
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because B is not a subset of A

e. A = {sqrt(16),{4}}
B = {4}
answer:
after evaluation
A = {4,{4}}
B = {4}

is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't have {4}
is B C A ? yes because 4 is included in set A
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? yes because B is a subset of A and set B does not equal to set A

f. A = {x E (is an element of ) R | cos x E Z}
B = {x E R | sin x E Z}

answer:
after evaluation

is A C B ? fals ebecause all elements in A is not withint B
is B C A ? false  because all elements in A is not withint B
is A is a proper subset of B ? false because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false because B is not a subset of A

2. complete the proof from example 6.1.3.
prove that B is a subset of A where

A = {m E Z | m = 2a for some integer a} and 
B = {n E Z | n = 2b-2 for some integer b}

answer: 
suppose X is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
[we must show that x E A. by definition of A, this means we must show that x = 2 . some integer]

by definition of B, there is an integer b such that x = 2b - 2
this can be factored as x = 2(b - 1)
which has the form 2 some integer

thus by definition x is an element of A
[as to be shown]

3. let sets R, S, and T be defined as follows:
R = {x E Z | X is divisible by 2}
S = {y E Z | y is divisible by 3}
T = {z E Z | z is divisible by 6}

prove or disprove each of the following statements
a. R C (is a subset of) T
answer:

we need to find one element in R that is not in T
the number 4 is in set R but it's not in set t
therefore we found a counterexample

b. T C R

disprove attempt
find one element in T not in R
it seems a number divisibel by 2 is also divisble by 2

proof attempt
lets pick an arbitrary element x from set T
by the definition of T, x is divisible by 6 -> x = 6k for some integer k

but by definition of R, an integer is divisble by 2 -> 2 . some integer

since we know 2 is a factor of 6 we can rewrite 2(3 . some integer)
which fits the definiton of R

therefore proven

c. T C S

disprove attempt
find one element in T that's not in S
it seems a number divisible by 6 is also divisible by 3

proof attempt
lets pick an arbitrary element x from set T
by the definition of T, x is divisble by 6, we can write this as x = 6k for some integer k
then we can refactor x = 3(2k). since 2k is an integer we know
this fits the definiton of S which is 3 . some integer
threfore proven

4. let A = {n E Z | n = 5r for some integer r}
let B = {m E Z | m = 20s for some integer s}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of ) B
answer:


we need to find an element in A that is not in B
we need to find an element that's a multiple of 5 but not a multiple of 20
counterexample: the number 5

5 is in set A but not in set B
therefore proven

b. B C A
answer:

disproof attempt
we need to find an element in B that's not in A
that is, we need to find integer multiple of 20 but not a multiple of 5
this is impossible because all multiple of 20 always have a factor of 5.


proof attempt:
suppose x is a particular but arbitraryly chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 5r for some integer r
by the defintion of B, we know that x = 20s for some integer s

step 2: show that x is also in A
we can rewrite this to fit A's definition
x = 5(4s) for some integer s
since 4s is an integer, this fits the definition of A
thus proven


5. let C = {n E Z | n = 6r-5 for some integer r}
let D = {m E Z | m = 3s+1 for some integer s}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. C C (is a subset of ) D
answer:

proof attempt:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of C
we must show that x is an element of D, we must show that x = 3s + 1 for some integer s

by the definition of C, we know that x = 6r-5 for some integer r
6r - 5 = 6r - 6 + 1
factor out the 6
3(2r-2) + 1
since 2r-2 is an integer (lets call it s)
we show that 3s+1 is true
therefore this fits the definition of D
proven


b. D C C
answer:

proof attempt:
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of D
we must show that x is an element of C, we must show that x = 6r-5 for some integer r

step 2:
show that x is also in C
6r-5 = ???

doesn't seem right, lets try to disprove it
pick 1 elment in D ->


3(-2)+1 = -5
3(-1)+1 = -2
3(0)+1 = 1
3(1)+1 = 4
3(2)+1 = 7
3(3)+1 = 10
3(4)+1 = 13

6(-1)-5 = -11
6(0)-5 = -5
6(1)-5 = 1
6(2)-5 = 7
6(3)-5 = 13

therefore 4 is a counterexample

6. let A = {x E Z | x = 5a+2 for some integer a}
let B = {y E Z | y = 10b-3 for some integer b}
let C = {z E Z | y = 10c+7 for some integer c}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of) B
answer:
a = 1 -> 5(1)+2 = 7
a = 2 -> 5(2)+2 = 12
a = 3 -> 5(3)+2 = 17
b = 1 -> 10(1)-3 = 7
b = 2 -> 10(2)-3 = 17
b = 3 -> 10(3)-3 = 27

therefore 12 is not in set B
coutnerexample found


b. B C (is a subset of) A
answer:
disprove attempt
b = 1 -> 10(1)-3 = 7
b = 2 -> 10(2)-3 = 17
b = 3 -> 10(3)-3 = 27
a = 1 -> 5(1)+2 = 7
a = 2 -> 5(2)+2 = 12
a = 3 -> 5(3)+2 = 17
a = 4 -> 5(4)+2 = 22
a = 4 -> 5(5)+2 = 27
seems like a true statement

proof attempt
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 5a+2 some integer a

step 2:
show that x is also in A
by the definition of B, x = 10b - 3
x = ... + 2
x = 10b - 5 + 2
x = 5(2b - 1) + 2
since 2b-1 is an integer, lets fcall it a
therefore 5a + 2 fits the definition of A
therefore proven

c. B = C
answer:
disprove attempt

b = 1 -> 10(1)-3 = 7
b = 2 -> 10(2)-3 = 17
b = 3 -> 10(3)-3 = 27

c = 1 -> 10(1)+7 = 17
c = 2 -> 10(2)+7 = 27
c = 3 -> 10(3)+7 = 37
not sure, lets try to prove it

prove attempt
first we need to prove
B C (is a subset of) C

step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of C, we must show that x = 10c+7 some integer c

step 2:
show that x is also in C
by the definition of B, x = 10b - 3
x = ... +  7
x = 10b - 10 + 7
x = 10(b - 1) + 7
since b-1 is an integer (lets call it c), therefore this fits the definition of C
therfore B is a subset of C

secondly, we need to prove
C C (is a subset of) B

step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of C
we must show that x is an element of B, we must show that x = 10b - 3 some integer b

step 2:
show that x is also in B
by the definition of C, x = 10c + 7
then
x = ... - 3
x = 10c + 10 - 3
x = 10(c + 1) - 3
since c + 1 is an integer (lets call it b)
then this fits the deifnition of B

therefore both proven

7.  let A = {x E Z | x = 6a+4 for some integer a}
let B = {y E Z | y = 18b-2 for some integer b}
let C = {z E Z | z = 18c+16 for some integer c}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of) B
disprove attempt
a = -1 -> x = 6(-1)+4 = -2
a = 0 -> x = 6(0)+4 = 4
a = 1 -> x = 6(1)+4 = 10
a = 2 -> x = 6(2)+4 = 16
a = 3 -> x = 6(3)+4 = 22
a = 4 -> x = 6(4)+4 = 28
a = 5 -> x = 6(5)+4 = 34

b = 0 -> y = 18(0)-2 = -2
b = 1 -> y = 18(1)-2 = 16
b = 2 -> y = 18(2)-2 = 34
b = 3 -> y = 18(3)-2 = 52

counterexample is 10 because 10 is in set A but not in B

b. B C (is a subset of) A
answer:
we need to find an element in B that's not in A
seems to be true from calculation in a), but i'm not sure
proof attempt

step 1
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 6a + 4 some integer a

step 2:
by the definition of B, x = 18b-2
x = ... + 4
x = 18b - 6 + 4
x = 6(3b - 1) + 4
since 3b - 1 is an integer (lets call it a), therefore we have 6a + 4
this fits the definition of A threfore provn

c. B = C
to prove this we need to show two things:
B is a subset of C
and C is a subset of B

case 1: we need to show that B is  a subset of C

b = 0 -> y = 18(0)-2 = -2
b = 1 -> y = 18(1)-2 = 16
b = 2 -> y = 18(2)-2 = 34
b = 3 -> y = 18(3)-2 = 52

c = 0 -> y = 18(0)+16 = 16
c = 0 -> y = 18(1)+16 = 34
c = 0 -> y = 18(2)+16 = 52
c = 0 -> y = 18(3)+16 = 70

seems to be true, lets go with a general proof
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of C, we must show that x = 18c+16 some integer c


step 2:
by the definition of B, x = 18b-2
x = ... +16
x = 18b - 18 + 16
x = 18(b - 1) + 16
since b-1 is an integer, lets call it c, therefore this fits the definition of C

case 2, we need to prove C is a subset of B
step 1:
suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of C
we must show that x is an element of B, we must show that x = 18b-2 some integer b

by the definition of C, x = 18c+16
x = ... - 2
x = 18c + 18 - 2
x = 18(c + 1) - 2
since c+1 is an integer, lets call it b, therefore this fits the definition of B

since both cases aretrue therefore proven

answer: a intersect b means x has to be in both a and b. so what makes x is not in this set is
the negation of that, so x is not in A or x is not in B

c. x E(slash) A - B, if and only if ____
answer: a - b means x is in A but it's not in B. so what makes x not in this set is the negation of that.

(A U B) A (A U C)
we know that A U B = {a,b,c,d}
and A U C = {a,b,c,e}
then (A U B) A (A U C) = {b,c}

the two equal sets are (A U B) A (A U C) and A U (B A C)

which of these sets are equal?
(B U C) = {b,c,d,e}
A A (B U C) = {b,c}

(A A B) U C
A A B = {b,c}
(A A B) U C = {b,c,e}

(A A B) U (A A C)
since we know A A B = {b,c}
A A C = {b,c}
then (A A B) U (A A C) = {b,c}

the equal sets are A A (B U C)  and (A A B) U (A A C)

c. find (A - B) - C and A - (B - C). are these sets equal?

no they are not equal

18.
a. is the number 0 in the empty set? why?
no because an empty set is just a set with empty element. 0 contains the number 0 whihc is 1 item

b. is empty set = {empty set}? why?
no because the empty set is just a set with no element. {} contains ane elmeent with an empty set (1 ellement)

c. is empty set E (is an element of) {empty set}? why?
yes because {empty set} contains an element which is the empty set

d. is empty set E empty set? why?
no because by definition empty set contains no element. therefore nothing, not even the empty set
it self can be an element of it

19. let Ai = {i, i^2} for each integer i = 1,2,3,4

for arbitrary intger n, the intersect is [0,0]
because its the smallest common value from all the sets

f. the union of d sub i from i = 0 to infinity = ?
(-infinity, infinity) or {-infinity <= x <= infinity}

g. the intersect of d sub i from i = 0 to infinity = ?
{0} because its the smallest common

b. the intersect of v sub i from i = 0 to 4 = ?
the intersect of these sets are v4 because its the smallest
which is common to all sets

c. are v0, v1, v2, ... mutually disjoint? explain
no because they contain an intersect, to be disjoint it needs to be the empty set/nothing in common
Because we can find at least one pair of sets that has a non-empty intersection, the entire collection cannot be considered mutually disjoint.

d. the union of v sub i from i = 0 to n = ?
let n = 2
v0 = {-1/0 <= x <= 1/0} = undefined
v1 = {-1/1 <= x <= 1/1}

for arbitrary n
the union is v1 {-1/1 <=x < 1/1} or [-1, 1]

e. the intersect of v sub i from i = 0 to n = ?
the intersect is vi because its the smallest common so {-1/i <=x <= 1/i} or [-1/n, 1/n]


d. the union of v sub i from i = 0 to infinity = ?
v1 or [-1,1]

e. the intersect of v sub i from i = 0 to infinity = ?

the union of these sets is w0

b. the intersect of w sub i from i = 0 to 4 = ?
the intersect of these sets are w4

c. are w0, w1, w2, ... mutually disjoint? explain
no because thei ntersection of these sets are not empty set.

the union of these sets is w0
for arbitrary number of n, the union of these set is still w0
since rest set is a subset of w0

e. the intersect of w sub i from i = 0 to n = ?
let n = 2
w0 = {x E R | x > 0}
w1 = {x E R | x > 1}
