Exercise set 6.1
1. in each of a - f , answer the following questions:
- is A C (is a subset of) B?
- is B C (is a subset of) A ?
- is either A or B a proper subset of the other?

a. A = {2,{2},sqrt(2)^2}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {2, {2}}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

is A C B ? true because all elements in A is within B, that is the number 2 and set {2}
is B C A ? false because the set A doesn't contain {{2}}
is A is a proper subset of B ? yes becuase A is a subset of B but B has extra element (A does not equal B)
is B is a proper subset of A ? no beacuse B is not a subset of A

b. A = {3, sqrt(5^2-4^2),24mod7}
B = {8mod5}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {3}
B = {3}

is A C B ? true because number 3 is in B
is B C A ? true because number 3 is in A
is A is a proper subset of B ? false even though A is a subset of B, A = B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false even though B is a subset of A, B = A

c. A = {{1,2},{2,3}}
B = {1,2,3}
answer:
is A C B ? no because set B doesn't contain {1,2} and {2,3}
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain the numbers 1, 2, 3
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because set A is not a subest of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because set B is not a subset of A

d. A = {a,b,c}
B = {{a},{b},{c}}
answer:
is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't contain a,b,c
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain {a}, {b} , {c}
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because B is not a subset of A

e. A = {sqrt(16),{4}}
B = {4}
answer:
after evaluation
A = {4,{4}}
B = {4}

is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't have {4}
is B C A ? yes because 4 is included in set A
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? yes because B is a subset of A and set B does not equal to set A

f. A = {x E (is an element of ) R | cos x E Z}
B = {x E R | sin x E Z}

answer:
after evaluation

is A C B ? fals ebecause all elements in A is not withint B
is B C A ? false  because all elements in A is not withint B
is A is a proper subset of B ? false because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false because B is not a subset of A

2. complete the proof from example 6.1.3.
prove that B is a subset of A where

A = {m E Z | m = 2a for some integer a} and 
B = {n E Z | n = 2b-2 for some integer b}

answer: 
suppose X is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
[we must show that x E A. by definition of A, this means we must show that x = 2 . some integer]

by definition of B, there is an integer b such that x = 2b - 2
this can be factored as x = 2(b - 1)
which has the form 2 some integer

thus by definition x is an element of A
[as to be shown]

3. let sets R, S, and T be defined as follows:
R = {}
S = {}
T = {}
