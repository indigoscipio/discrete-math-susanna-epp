Exercise set 6.1
1. in each of a - f , answer the following questions:
- is A C (is a subset of) B?
- is B C (is a subset of) A ?
- is either A or B a proper subset of the other?

a. A = {2,{2},sqrt(2)^2}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {2, {2}}
B = {2,{2},{{2}}}

is A C B ? true because all elements in A is within B, that is the number 2 and set {2}
is B C A ? false because the set A doesn't contain {{2}}
is A is a proper subset of B ? yes becuase A is a subset of B but B has extra element (A does not equal B)
is B is a proper subset of A ? no beacuse B is not a subset of A

b. A = {3, sqrt(5^2-4^2),24mod7}
B = {8mod5}

answer:
after evaluation
A = {3}
B = {3}

is A C B ? true because number 3 is in B
is B C A ? true because number 3 is in A
is A is a proper subset of B ? false even though A is a subset of B, A = B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false even though B is a subset of A, B = A

c. A = {{1,2},{2,3}}
B = {1,2,3}
answer:
is A C B ? no because set B doesn't contain {1,2} and {2,3}
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain the numbers 1, 2, 3
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because set A is not a subest of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because set B is not a subset of A

d. A = {a,b,c}
B = {{a},{b},{c}}
answer:
is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't contain a,b,c
is B C A ? no because set A doesn't contain {a}, {b} , {c}
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? no because B is not a subset of A

e. A = {sqrt(16),{4}}
B = {4}
answer:
after evaluation
A = {4,{4}}
B = {4}

is A C B ? no because the set B doesn't have {4}
is B C A ? yes because 4 is included in set A
is A is a proper subset of B ? no because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? yes because B is a subset of A and set B does not equal to set A

f. A = {x E (is an element of ) R | cos x E Z}
B = {x E R | sin x E Z}

answer:
after evaluation

is A C B ? fals ebecause all elements in A is not withint B
is B C A ? false  because all elements in A is not withint B
is A is a proper subset of B ? false because A is not a subset of B
is B is a proper subset of A ? false because B is not a subset of A

2. complete the proof from example 6.1.3.
prove that B is a subset of A where

A = {m E Z | m = 2a for some integer a} and 
B = {n E Z | n = 2b-2 for some integer b}

answer: 
suppose X is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of B
[we must show that x E A. by definition of A, this means we must show that x = 2 . some integer]

by definition of B, there is an integer b such that x = 2b - 2
this can be factored as x = 2(b - 1)
which has the form 2 some integer

thus by definition x is an element of A
[as to be shown]

3. let sets R, S, and T be defined as follows:
R = {x E Z | X is divisible by 2}
S = {y E Z | y is divisible by 3}
T = {z E Z | z is divisible by 6}

prove or disprove each of the following statements
a. R C (is a subset of) T
answer:

we need to find one element in R that is not in T
the number 4 is in set R but it's not in set t
therefore we found a counterexample

b. T C R

disprove attempt
find one element in T not in R
it seems a number divisibel by 2 is also divisble by 2

proof attempt
lets pick an arbitrary element x from set T
by the definition of T, x is divisible by 6 -> x = 6k for some integer k

but by definition of R, an integer is divisble by 2 -> 2 . some integer

since we know 2 is a factor of 6 we can rewrite 2(3 . some integer)
which fits the definiton of R

therefore proven

c. T C S

disprove attempt
find one element in T that's not in S
it seems a number divisible by 6 is also divisible by 3

proof attempt
lets pick an arbitrary element x from set T
by the definition of T, x is divisble by 6, we can write this as x = 6k for some integer k
then we can refactor x = 3(2k). since 2k is an integer we know
this fits the definiton of S which is 3 . some integer
threfore proven

4. let A = {n E Z | n = 5r for some integer r}
let B = {m E Z | m = 20s for some integer s}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of ) B
answer:


we need to find an element in A that is not in B
we need to find an element that's a multiple of 5 but not a multiple of 20
counterexample: the number 5

5 is in set A but not in set B
therefore proven

b. B C A
answer:

disproof attempt
we need to find an element in B that's not in A
that is, we need to find integer multiple of 20 but not a multiple of 5
this is impossible because all multiple of 20 always have a factor of 5.


proof attempt:
suppose x is a particular but arbitraryly chosen element of B
we must show that x is an element of A, we must show that x = 5r for some integer r
by the defintion of B, we know that x = 20s for some integer s

step 2: show that x is also in A
we can rewrite this to fit A's definition
x = 5(4s) for some integer s
since 4s is an integer, this fits the definition of A
thus proven


4. let C = {n E Z | n = 6r-5 for some integer r}
let D = {m E Z | m = 20s for some integer s}
Prove or disprove each of the following statements.
a. A C (is a subset of ) B
answer:

suppose x is a particular but arbitraryly chosen element of A
we must show that x is an element of B, we must show that x = 6r-5 for some integer r

step 1:

step 2:


b. B C A
answer:
