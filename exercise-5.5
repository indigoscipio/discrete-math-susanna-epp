1. a pre-condition for an algorithm is ___
and a post-condition for an algorithm is ___
answer: a condition that must be true before evaluating the loop/body of the algorithm
a final answer after evaluating the body of the algorithm

2.  A loop is defined as correct with respect to its 
pre- and post-conditions if, and only if, whenever 
the algorithm variables satisfy the pre-condition 
for the loop and the loop terminates after a finite 
number of steps, then ___
answer: 

3. for each iteration of the loop, if a loop invariant is true before iteration of the loop,
then the iteration will be executed until the guard is false

4. given a while loop with guard G and a predicate i(n) if the folowing properties are true, then the loop is correct
with respect to its pre-and post conditions
a) the pre-cond for the loop implies that ___ before
the first iteration of the loop
b) for every integer k>= 0, if the guard g and the predicate i(k) are both true before an iteration of the loop,
then ___
c) after a finite number of iterations of the loop, ___
d) if N is the least number of iteration after which G is false and i(N) is true, then
the values of the algorithm variables will be as as specified ___
answer:
a)
b)
c)
d)
