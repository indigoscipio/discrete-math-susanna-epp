; p -> q ~p V q

exercise set 2.2
Rewrite the statements in 1–4 in if-then form.
1. thie loop will repeat exactly N times if it does not contain a stop or a go to
p = this loop will repat exactly n times
q = if it does not contain a stop or a go to
If it does no contain stop or a go to, this loop will repeat exactly n times

2. i am on time for word if I catch the 8:05 bus
p = i am on time for work
q = i watch the 805 bus
p -> q
If i catch the 805 bus, then i am on time  for work

3. freeze or i'll shoot
p = freeze
q = illl shot
p V q = ~p V q
if you don't freeze, then I will shoot

4. fix my ceiling or i won't pay my rent
p = fix my celing
q = i wont pay my rent
p V q = ~p V q
if my ceiling is not fixed, then I won't pay my rent

12. Use the logical equivalence established in  
Example 2.2.3, p V q -> r = (p -> r) A (q -> r), 

to rewrite the following statement. (Assume that x 
represents a fixed real number.)

 If x > 2 or x < -2, then x^2 > 4.
p = x > 2
q= x < -2
r = x^2 > 4

 (p -> r) A (q -> r)
 if x > 2 then x^2 > 4 AND if x < -2 r = x^2 > 4

Use truth tables to verify the following logical 
equivalences. Include a few words of explanation 
with your answers.

yes, these two statements are logically equivalence as shown from the truth table

logically equivalent:

Yes, based on the truth table above, these 3 have the same trueth value

14b. Use the logical equivalences established in part 
(a) to rewrite the following sentence in two dif
ferent ways. (Assume that n represents a fixed 
integer.)

 If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2.
 p = n is prime
 q = n is odd
 r = n is 2

That's the first one =  p -> q V r
2nd way:   p A ~q -> r
if n is prime and n is even then n is 2

3rd way: p A ~r -> q
if n is prime and n is not 2, then n is odd

15. Determine whether the following statement forms 
are logically equivalent:

 p -> (q -> r) and (p -> q) -> r
 p -> (~q V r)
 ~p V (~q V r)


(~p V q) -> r
~(~p V q) V r
(p A ~q) V r

no, these two statements are not logically equivanlent as shown on truth table above

 In 16 and 17, write each of the two statements in symbolic 
form and determine whether they are logically equiva
lent. Include a truth table and a few words of explanation 
to show that you understand what it means for state
ments to be logically equivalent.

16. If you paid full price, you didn’t buy it at Crown 
Books. You didn’t buy it at Crown Books or you 
paid full price.
p = paid full price
q = didn't buy it at crown books
p -> q

you didn't buy it at crown books or you paid full price
q V p
I don't think these two statements are logically equivealent. the logical equivalent of if p -> q is ~p V q, not q V p.
q V p is a converse of the original statmeent. proof on truth table below

p   q   ~p   ~q     q V p    p -> q         ~p V q
T   T   F    F      T        T              T

F   F   T    T      F        T              T

17. If 2 is a factor of n and 3 is a factor of n, then 6 is 
a factor of n. 2 is not a factor of n or 3 is not a fac
tor of n or 6 is a factor of n.
p = 2 is a factor of n
q = 3 is a factor of n
r = 6 is a factor of n

1st stentnce = p A q -> r
2nd sentence = ~p V ~q V r

are these two logically equivalent? my intuition says yes but lets prove it with the truth table
