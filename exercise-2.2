; p -> q ~p V q

exercise set 2.2
Rewrite the statements in 1–4 in if-then form.
1. thie loop will repeat exactly N times if it does not contain a stop or a go to
p = this loop will repat exactly n times
q = if it does not contain a stop or a go to
If it does no contain stop or a go to, this loop will repeat exactly n times

2. i am on time for word if I catch the 8:05 bus
p = i am on time for work
q = i watch the 805 bus
p -> q
If i catch the 805 bus, then i am on time  for work

3. freeze or i'll shoot
p = freeze
q = illl shot
p V q = ~p V q
if you don't freeze, then I will shoot

4. fix my ceiling or i won't pay my rent
p = fix my celing
q = i wont pay my rent
p V q = ~p V q
if my ceiling is not fixed, then I won't pay my rent

12. Use the logical equivalence established in  
Example 2.2.3, p V q -> r = (p -> r) A (q -> r), 

to rewrite the following statement. (Assume that x 
represents a fixed real number.)

 If x > 2 or x < -2, then x^2 > 4.
p = x > 2
q= x < -2
r = x^2 > 4

 (p -> r) A (q -> r)
 if x > 2 then x^2 > 4 AND if x < -2 r = x^2 > 4

Use truth tables to verify the following logical 
equivalences. Include a few words of explanation

Yes, based on the truth table above, these 3 have the same trueth value

14b. Use the logical equivalences established in part 
(a) to rewrite the following sentence in two dif
ferent ways. (Assume that n represents a fixed 
integer.)

 If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2.
 p = n is prime
 q = n is odd
 r = n is 2

That's the first one =  p -> q V r
2nd way:   p A ~q -> r
if n is prime and n is even then n is 2

3rd way: p A ~r -> q
if n is prime and n is not 2, then n is odd

15. Determine whether the following statement forms 
are logically equivalent:

 p -> (q -> r) and (p -> q) -> r
 p -> (~q V r)
 ~p V (~q V r)


(~p V q) -> r
~(~p V q) V r
(p A ~q) V r

no, these two statements are not logically equivanlent as shown on truth table above

 In 16 and 17, write each of the two statements in symbolic 
form and determine whether they are logically equiva
lent. Include a truth table and a few words of explanation 
to show that you understand what it means for state
ments to be logically equivalent.

16. If you paid full price, you didn’t buy it at Crown 
Books. You didn’t buy it at Crown Books or you 
paid full price.
p = paid full price
q = didn't buy it at crown books
p -> q

you didn't buy it at crown books or you paid full price
q V p
I don't think these two statements are logically equivealent. the logical equivalent of if p -> q is ~p V q, not q V p.
q V p is a converse of the original statmeent. proof on truth table below

p   q   ~p   ~q     q V p    p -> q         ~p V q

17. If 2 is a factor of n and 3 is a factor of n, then 6 is 
a factor of n. 2 is not a factor of n or 3 is not a fac
tor of n or 6 is a factor of n.
p = 2 is a factor of n
q = 3 is a factor of n
r = 6 is a factor of n

1st stentnce = p A q -> r
2nd sentence = ~p V ~q V r

are these two logically equivalent? my intuition says yes but lets prove it with the truth table

F   F   F   T   T   T   F       T           T               T

yes, those two are logically equivalent based on the truth table.

18. Write each of the following three statements in 
symbolic form and determine which pairs are 
logically equivalent. Include truth tables and a few 
words of explanation.

a. If it walks like a duck and it talks like a duck, then 
it is a duck.
p = if it walks like a duck
q = it talks like a duck
r = it is a duck
(p A q) -> r

b. Either it does not walk like a duck or it does not 
talk like a duck, or it is a duck.
(~p V ~q) V r


c. If it does not walk like a duck and it does not talk 
like a duck, then it is not a duck.
(~p A ~q) -> ~r


p   q   r    ~p  ~q  ~r     p A q  p A q -> r  ~p V ~q      (~p V ~q) V r       (~p A ~q)       (~p A ~q) -> ~r

final answer: a & b is logically equivalent. c is not logically equivalent with both a and b

19. True or false? The negation of “If Sue is Luiz’s 
mother, then Ali is his cousin” is “If Sue is Luiz’s 
mother, then Ali is not his cousin.”

p = sue is luiz's mother
q = ali is his cousin
p -> q = ~p V q

p -> ~q
this is false.
negation of a if-then statement shold follow this structure: p A ~q
so the negation should be sue is luiz's mother AND ali is not his cousin

20. Write negations for each of the following state
ments. (Assume that all variables represent fixed 
quantities or entities, as appropriate.)

a. If P is a square, then P is a rectangle.
p = p is a square
q = p is a rectangle
original = p -> q, negation is p A ~q = p is a square and p is not a rectangle

b. If today is New Year’s Eve, then tomorrow is 
January.
p = today is new years eve, q = tomorrow is january = p -> q
negation = p A ~q = today is new years eve and tomorrow is not january

c. If the decimal expansion of r is terminating, then r is rational.
p =  decimal expansion or r is terminatin
q = r is rationsal
p -> q, negation is p A ~q = the decimal expansion is terminating and r is irrational

d. If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2
p = n is prime, q = n is odd, r = n is 2
original statment = p -> (q V r)
negation = p A ~(q V r) = p A ~q A ~r = n is prime and n is even and r is not 2

e. If x is nonnegative, then x is positive or x is 0.
p = x is nonnegative
q = x is positive
r = x is o
os = p -> q V r
negation = p A ~(q V r) = p A ~q A ~r = x is nonnegative and x is not positive and x is not 0

21.  Suppose that p and q are statements so that  
p -> q is false. Find the truth values of each of 
the following:
a. ~p -> q
b. p V q
c. q -> p

for p -> q to be false, q must be false and p must be true
a. ~p -> q = true -> true = true
b. p V q = true OR false = true
c. q -> p = false -> true = true
therefore, all three statements have a true truth value

28. “Do you mean that you think you can find out the 
answer to it?” said the March Hare.
 “Exactly so,” said Alice.
 “Then you should say what you mean,” the 
March Hare went on.
 “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least 
I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you 
know.”
 “Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. 
“Why, you might just as well say that ‘I see what I 
eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
 —from “A Mad Tea-Party” in Alice in  
Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
 The Hatter is right. “I say what I mean” is not the 
same thing as “I mean what I say.” Rewrite each 
of these two sentences in if-then form and explain 
the logical relation between them. (This exercise is 
referred to in the introduction to Chapter 4.)

p = i say something
q = i mean something

p -> q = if i say something, then i mean something
q -> p = if i mean something, then I say something

these two are not logically equivalent, the only possibility when the sentence is equivalent to is its contrapositive.
~q -> ~p = if i don't mean something, then I don't say something

If statement forms P and Q are logically equivalent, then 
P <-> Q is a tautology. Conversely, if P <-> Q is a tautology, 
then P and Q are logically equivalent. Use <-> to convert 
each of the logical equivalences in 29–31 to a tautology. 
Then use a truth table to verify each tautology.

p & q = logically equivalent
p <-> q = tautology

 Rewrite each of the statements in 32 and 33 as a conjunc
tion of two if-then statements
32.  This quadratic equation has two distinct real roots if, 
and only if, its discriminant is greater than zero.
p = quadratic equation has two distint real roots
q = its discirminant is greater than zero

p -> q A q -> p
answer: if the quadratis equation ahs two distinct real roots, its discriminant is greater than zero and if the discriminant
is greater han zeor, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots

33. This integer is even if, and only if, it equals twice 
some integer
q = this intener is even

 Rewrite the statements in 34 and 35 in if-then form in two 
ways, one of which is the contrapositive of the other. Use 
the formal definition of “only if.”

34. The Cubs will win the pennant only if they win 
tomorrow’s game.
p = cubs will win the pnnant
q = they win tomorrows game
p -> q = ~q -> ~p
v1: the cubs lose tomorrows them then the cubs will not win the pennant
v2: if the cubs wins the pennant, then they will have win tomorrow s game

35. Sam will be allowed on Signe’s racing boat only if 
he is an expert sailor.
p = sam is allowed on signe's racing boat

36.Taking the long view on your education, you go to 
the Prestige Corporation and ask what you should 
do in college to be hired when you graduate. The 
personnel director replies that you will be hired 
only if you major in mathematics or computer sci
ence, get a B average or better, and take account
ing. You do, in fact, become a math major, get a 
B+ average, and take accounting. You return to 
Prestige Corporation, make a formal application, 
and are turned down. Did the personnel director 
lie to you?


hiring requirements ONLY IF 
p = you major in computer sicence or mathematics
q = get a B average or bettter
r = take accounting
s = you are hired

(p A q A s) -> s

what happens

(p A q A s) -> ~s
this is a false statement, if the ocnlucion is false and the hyphotesis is true. therefore he lies .

 Some programming languages use statements of the form 
“r unless s” to mean that as long as s does not happen, 
then r will happen. More formally:
 Definition: If r and s are statements,
 r unless s means if ~s then r

 In 37–39, rewrite the statements in if-then form.
 37. Payment will be made on fifth unless a new hear
ing is granted
p = payment made on fifth
q = a new hearing is granted
p unless q = ~q -> r = if a new hearing is not granted, then payment willl be  made on fifth

38. ann will go unless it rains
p unless q = ~q -> r = if it does not rain then ann will go

39. This door will not open unless a security code is 
entered.
p = door will not open, q = security code is entered
p unless q = ~q -> p = if the security code is not entered then the door will not open

 Rewrite the statements in 40 and 41 in if-then form
40. Catching the 8:05 bus is a sufficient condition for 
my being on time for work
sufficient = if p then q
p = catching the 805 bus
q = being on time for work
rewritten = if i catch the 805 bus, then i am on time for work


41. Having two 45° angles is a sufficient condition for 
this triangle to be a right triangle
p = triangle have two 45deg angles
q = triangle is a right triangle
sufficient = p  -> q = if this triangle have two 45deg angles, the it is a right triangle

 Use the contrapositive to rewrite the statements in 
42 and 43 in if-then form in two ways.

42. Being divisible by 3 is a necessary condition for 
this number to be divisible by 9.
p = number is divisible by 3
q = number is divisible by 9
original statement: q -> p
necessary = ~p -> ~q = if this number is not divisible by 3 then this number is not divisible by 9

43. Doing homework regularly is a necessary condi
tion for Jim to pass the course.
p = doing homework regularly
q = jim pass the course
p is necessary for q = if q happens, then p mst have happen =  q -> p = ~p -> q
if jim is not doing homework regularly, then jim fails the course

 Note that “a sufficient condition for s is r” means r 
is a sufficient condition for s and that “a necessary 
condition for s is r” means r is a necessary condition 
for s. Rewrite the statements in 44 and 45 in if
then form.

44.A sufficient condition for Jon’s team to win 
the championship is that it win the rest of 
its games.
p = jons team wins the champtionship
q = jons team win the rest of it gmaes
sufficient = q -> p
if jons team wins rest of it games then jon wins the championship

45. A necessary condition for this computer program 
to be correct is that it not produce error messages 
during translation.
p = this computer program is correct
q = it does not produce erorr mesage during trnslation
rewritten = not produving error message is a necesary condition for it to be a correct pgogram.
which means q is necessary for p
which means p -> q = if this computer program is   correct then it does not produces error message during translation

45.If compound X is boiling, then its temperature 
must be at least 150°C.” Assuming that this 
statement is true, which of the following must 
also be true?

p = compound x is boiling
q = temperature must be at least 150c
assume the statement is true p -> q = true

a.If the temperature of compound X is at least 
150°C, then compound X is boiling.
q -> p this is the converse of the original statement, so not true

b. If the temperature of compound X is less than 
150°C, then compound X is not boiling.
~q -> ~p  - this is the contrapositive - true statement

c.Compound X will boil only if its temperature 
is at least 150°C

and p <-> q = (~p V q) A (~q V p) to rewrite the given 
statement forms without using the symbol -> or <->, 
and (b) use the logical equivalence p V q = ~(~p A ~q)

Given any statement form, is it possible to find a 
logically equivalent form that uses only ~ and A? 
Justify your answer.

I don't think its possible. I don't know, why would you do that?
