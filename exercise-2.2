; p -> q ~p V q

exercise set 2.2
Rewrite the statements in 1–4 in if-then form.
1. thie loop will repeat exactly N times if it does not contain a stop or a go to
p = this loop will repat exactly n times
q = if it does not contain a stop or a go to
If it does no contain stop or a go to, this loop will repeat exactly n times

2. i am on time for word if I catch the 8:05 bus
p = i am on time for work
q = i watch the 805 bus
p -> q
If i catch the 805 bus, then i am on time  for work

3. freeze or i'll shoot
p = freeze
q = illl shot
p V q = ~p V q
if you don't freeze, then I will shoot

4. fix my ceiling or i won't pay my rent
p = fix my celing
q = i wont pay my rent
p V q = ~p V q
if my ceiling is not fixed, then I won't pay my rent

12. Use the logical equivalence established in  
Example 2.2.3, p V q -> r = (p -> r) A (q -> r), 

to rewrite the following statement. (Assume that x 
represents a fixed real number.)

 If x > 2 or x < -2, then x^2 > 4.
p = x > 2
q= x < -2
r = x^2 > 4

 (p -> r) A (q -> r)
 if x > 2 then x^2 > 4 AND if x < -2 r = x^2 > 4

Use truth tables to verify the following logical 
equivalences. Include a few words of explanation

Yes, based on the truth table above, these 3 have the same trueth value

14b. Use the logical equivalences established in part 
(a) to rewrite the following sentence in two dif
ferent ways. (Assume that n represents a fixed 
integer.)

 If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2.
 p = n is prime
 q = n is odd
 r = n is 2

That's the first one =  p -> q V r
2nd way:   p A ~q -> r
if n is prime and n is even then n is 2

3rd way: p A ~r -> q
if n is prime and n is not 2, then n is odd

15. Determine whether the following statement forms 
are logically equivalent:

 p -> (q -> r) and (p -> q) -> r
 p -> (~q V r)
 ~p V (~q V r)


(~p V q) -> r
~(~p V q) V r
(p A ~q) V r

no, these two statements are not logically equivanlent as shown on truth table above

 In 16 and 17, write each of the two statements in symbolic 
form and determine whether they are logically equiva
lent. Include a truth table and a few words of explanation 
to show that you understand what it means for state
ments to be logically equivalent.

16. If you paid full price, you didn’t buy it at Crown 
Books. You didn’t buy it at Crown Books or you 
paid full price.
p = paid full price
q = didn't buy it at crown books
p -> q

you didn't buy it at crown books or you paid full price
q V p
I don't think these two statements are logically equivealent. the logical equivalent of if p -> q is ~p V q, not q V p.
q V p is a converse of the original statmeent. proof on truth table below

p   q   ~p   ~q     q V p    p -> q         ~p V q

17. If 2 is a factor of n and 3 is a factor of n, then 6 is 
a factor of n. 2 is not a factor of n or 3 is not a fac
tor of n or 6 is a factor of n.
p = 2 is a factor of n
q = 3 is a factor of n
r = 6 is a factor of n

1st stentnce = p A q -> r
2nd sentence = ~p V ~q V r

are these two logically equivalent? my intuition says yes but lets prove it with the truth table

F   F   F   T   T   T   F       T           T               T

yes, those two are logically equivalent based on the truth table.

18. Write each of the following three statements in 
symbolic form and determine which pairs are 
logically equivalent. Include truth tables and a few 
words of explanation.

a. If it walks like a duck and it talks like a duck, then 
it is a duck.
p = if it walks like a duck
q = it talks like a duck
r = it is a duck
(p A q) -> r

b. Either it does not walk like a duck or it does not 
talk like a duck, or it is a duck.
(~p V ~q) V r


c. If it does not walk like a duck and it does not talk 
like a duck, then it is not a duck.
(~p A ~q) -> ~r


p   q   r    ~p  ~q  ~r     p A q  p A q -> r  ~p V ~q      (~p V ~q) V r       (~p A ~q)       (~p A ~q) -> ~r

final answer: a & b is logically equivalent. c is not logically equivalent with both a and b

19. True or false? The negation of “If Sue is Luiz’s 
mother, then Ali is his cousin” is “If Sue is Luiz’s 
mother, then Ali is not his cousin.”

p = sue is luiz's mother
q = ali is his cousin
p -> q = ~p V q

p -> ~q
this is false.
negation of a if-then statement shold follow this structure: p A ~q
so the negation should be sue is luiz's mother AND ali is not his cousin

20. Write negations for each of the following state
ments. (Assume that all variables represent fixed 
quantities or entities, as appropriate.)

a. If P is a square, then P is a rectangle.
p = p is a square
q = p is a rectangle
original = p -> q, negation is p A ~q = p is a square and p is not a rectangle

b. If today is New Year’s Eve, then tomorrow is 
January.
p = today is new years eve, q = tomorrow is january = p -> q
negation = p A ~q = today is new years eve and tomorrow is not january

c. If the decimal expansion of r is terminating, then r is rational.
p =  decimal expansion or r is terminatin
q = r is rationsal
p -> q, negation is p A ~q = the decimal expansion is terminating and r is irrational

d. If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2
p = n is prime, q = n is odd, r = n is 2
original statment = p -> (q V r)
negation = p A ~(q V r) = p A ~q A ~r = n is prime and n is even and r is not 2

e. If x is nonnegative, then x is positive or x is 0.
p = x is nonnegative
q = x is positive
r = x is o
os = p -> q V r
negation = p A ~(q V r) = p A ~q A ~r = x is nonnegative and x is not positive and x is not 0

f. if Tom is Ann’s father, then Jim is her uncle 
and Sue is her aunt.
p = tom is ans father, q = jim is her uncle, r = sue is her aunt
os = p -> (q A r)
negation = p A ~(q A r) = p A ~q V ~r = tom is anns father and jim is not her uncle or sue is not her aunt

g. If n is divisible by 6, then n is divisible by 2 and n is divisible by 3.
p = n is divisible by 6, q =  n is divisible by 2, r = n is divisible by 3.
os = p -> q A r
negation = p A ~(q A r) = p A ~q V ~r = n is divisible by 6 and n is not disible by 2 or n is not divisible by 3

21.  Suppose that p and q are statements so that  
p -> q is false. Find the truth values of each of 
the following:
a. ~p -> q
b. p V q
c. q -> p

for p -> q to be false, q must be false and p must be true
a. ~p -> q = true -> true = true
b. p V q = true OR false = true
c. q -> p = false -> true = true
therefore, all three statements have a true truth value


22. Write contrapositives for the statements of exercise 20
a. If P is a square, then P is a rectangle.
p = p is a square
q = p is a rectangle
original = p -> q, contrapositive is ~q -> ~p = if p is not a rectangle, then p is not a square.

b. If today is New Year’s Eve, then tomorrow is 
January.
p = today is new years eve, q = tomorrow is january = p -> q
contrapositive = ~q -> ~p = if tomorrow is not january then today is not new years eve

c. If the decimal expansion of r is terminating, then r is rational.
p =  decimal expansion or r is terminatin
q = r is rationsal
p -> q, contrapositive is ~q -> ~p = if r is irrational, then decimal expansion of n is not terminating

d. If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2
p = n is prime, q = n is odd, r = n is 2
original statment = p -> (q V r)
contrapositive = ~(q V r) -> ~p = (~q A ~r) -> ~p
if n is even and n is not 2, then n is not prime

e. If x is nonnegative, then x is positive or x is 0.
p = x is nonnegative
q = x is positive
r = x is o
os = p -> q V r
copntrapositive = ~ (q V r) -> ~p = (~q A ~r) -> ~p
if x is not positive and x is not 0 then p is not nonnegative

f. if Tom is Ann’s father, then Jim is her uncle 
and Sue is her aunt.
p = tom is ans father, q = jim is her uncle, r = sue is her aunt
os = p -> (q A r)
contrapositive = ~(q A r) -> ~p = ~q V ~r -> ~p
if jim is not her uncle or sue is not her aunt then tom is not anns father

g. If n is divisible by 6, then n is divisible by 2 and n is divisible by 3.
p = n is divisible by 6, q =  n is divisible by 2, r = n is divisible by 3.
os = p -> q A r
contrapositie = ~(q A r) -> ~q = ~q V ~r -> ~q = if n is not divisible by 2 or n is not divisible by 3, then n is not divisible by 6

23. Write the converse and inverse for each statement 
of exercise 20.
a. If P is a square, then P is a rectangle.
p = p is a square
q = p is a rectangle
original = p -> q, converse = q -> p, inverse = ~p -> ~q
conserse = if p is a rectangle, then p is a square
inverse = if p is not a square, then p is not a rectangle


b. If today is New Year’s Eve, then tomorrow is 
January.
p = today is new years eve, q = tomorrow is january = p -> q
converse = q -> p = if tomorrow is january then today is new years eve
inverse = ~p -> ~q = if today is not new years eve then tomorrow is not january

c. p =  decimal expansion or r is terminatin
q = r is rationsal
converse = q -> p = if r is rational then decimal expansion of r is terminating
inverse = ~p -> ~q = if decimal expansion of r is not terminating then r is not rational

d. If n is prime, then n is odd or n is 2
p = n is prime, q = n is odd, r = n is 2
original statment = p -> (q V r)
contrapositive = ~(q V r) -> ~p = (~q A ~r) -> ~p
if n is even and n is not 2, then n is not prime
