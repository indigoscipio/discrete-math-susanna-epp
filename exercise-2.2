test yourself
1. an if-then statement is false if and only if the hyphothesis is true and the conslusion is false
2. the negation of if p then q is p A ~q (p and not q)
3. the ocnverse of if p then q is if q then P (q -> p)
4. the contrapositive of if p then q is if not q then not p (~q -> ~p)
5. the inverse of if p then q is if not p then not q (~p -> ~q)
6. a conditiona lstatement and its contrapostiive are logicaly equivalent
7. a conditional statement and its converse is not logically equivalent
8. R is a sufficient conditino for S means if r then s
9. R is a necessary condition for S means if not r then not s
10. R only if S means if R then S or if not s then not r

; p -> q ~p V q

exercise set 2.2
Rewrite the statements in 1â€“4 in if-then form.
1. thie loop will repeat exactly N times if it does not contain a stop or a go to
p = this loop will repat exactly n times
q = if it does not contain a stop or a go to
If the loop repeats n times, then it does not contain a stop or a go

2. i am on time for word if I catch the 8:05 bus
p = i am on time for work
q = i watch the 805 bus
p -> q
If i an on time for work then I have catched the 805 bus

3. freeze or i'll shoot
p = freeze
q = illl shot
p V q = ~p V q
if you don't freeze, then I will shoot

4. fix my ceiling or i won't pay my rent
p = fix my celing
q = i wont pay my rent
p V q = ~p V q
if my ceiling is not fixed, then I won't pay my rent
