3) given any two distinct numbers, there is a real number in between t hem
a) given any two distinct numbers a and b, there is a real number c such that c is between a and b
b) for any two numbers a b, tere exist c such that c is between a and b

4) gigven any rela number, there is a real number that is greater
a) given any real number r, there is a number s such that s is greater than r
b) for any real number r, there exists number s such that s > r

5) the reciprocal of any positive rela number is potiive
a) given any positive rela number r, the reciprocal of r is also positive
b) for any real number r, if r is positive, then its reciprocal is also positive
c) if a number r is positive, then its reciprocal is positive

6) the cube root of any negative real unmber is negative
a) given any negative real number s, the cube root of s is negative

7) rewrite the following statmeents less formally without using variables. determine as best as you can wheter the satements are true or false
a) there are real numbers u and v with the property that u + v < u - v
or There's exists a numbers u and v with the property that u  + v is less than u - v
3 + 5 < 3 - 5 = 8 < -2 = false
-3 + -1 < -3 - (-1) = -4 < -2 = true
the statement is therefore true

b) theres a real number x such that x square < x
or There exists a real number x where its square is less than x
4 x 4 < 4 = 16 < 4 = false
-2 x -2 < -2 = 4 < -2 = false
the statement is false

c) for every positive integer n, n suqared is greater or equal than n
or for all positive integer n, n square square is greater or euql than n
1 x 1 >= 1 = true
2 x 2 >= 2 = true
333 x 333 >= 333 = true
the statement is true

d) for all real numbers a and b, the sum of absolute values |a and b| is less than or equal to absolute value of a plus absolute value of b
| 1 + 2 | <= |1| + |2| = |3| <= |3| = true
| -1 + 2 | <= |1| + |2| = |1| <= 3 = true
the statement is true
