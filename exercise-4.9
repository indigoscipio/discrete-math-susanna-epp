1. the total degree of a graph is defined as
answer: the total sum of degrees of all vertices

2. the handshake theorem states that the total degree of a graph is 
answer: equal to the number of edges of a graph

3. in any graph the number of vertices of odd degree is ___ 
answer: even (since 2 . odd = even)

4. a simple graph is
answer: a graph that does not have paralel edge or loop edge

5. a complete graph on n vertices is a 
answer: graph that has 1 edge connecting to all vertices

6. 
A complete bipartite graph on (m, n) vertices is a 
simple graph whose vertices can be divided into 
two distinct, non-overlapping sets, say V with m 
vertices and W with m vertices, in such a way that

(1) there is ___ from each vertex of V to each vertex of W,
(2) there is ___ from any one vertex of V to any other of V, and
(3) there is  ___ from any one vertex of W to any other vertex of W.

answer: 
1. one
2. no edge
3.no edge

Exercise set 4.9

14. 
2p + 1p
5p + 2p
rest + 3p
15p knew each other (total edges)

a.how many people attending the party knew three other people before the party?
answer: 

2.1 + 5 . 2 + 3 . x
2 + 10 + 3x

12 + 3x
total degree = 2 . 15 = 30

12 + 3x = 30
3x = 30 - 12
3x = 18
x = 6
6 people knew three other people before the party

b.how many people attended the party?
answer: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13

15. action/degree = friends with
3p + 6p
1p + 5p
5p + 4p
rest + 3p
41 pairs of network friends (total edges)

a. how many people are network friends with three other people in the network?
answer

3.6 + 1.5 + 5.4 + x.3
18+5+20+3x
43+3x
total degree = 2.41 = 82

43+3x = 82
3x = 82 - 43
3x = 39
x = 13
13 people are network friends with three other people

b. how many people are in the network?
answer: 3+1+5+13 = 22 people

16.
a. In a group of 15 people, is it possible for each 
person to have exactly 3 friends? Justify your 
answer. (Assume that friendship is a symmet
ric relationship: If x is a friend of y, then y is a 
friend of x.)

vertex = 15
with 3 degree each
total degree = 15.3 = 45
since the total degree needs to be even therefore its impossible

b. in a group of 4 people, is it possible for each person to have exactly 3 friends?
vetex= 4
degree of each vertex = 3
4 . 3 = 12, so it's possible 

17. In a group of 25 people, is it possible for each to 
shake hands with exactly 3 other people? Justify 
your answer.
v = 25
degree of each vertex = 3
total degree = 25 . 3 = 75 = odd
therefore it's impossible

18. Is there a simple graph, each of whose vertices has 
even degree? Justify your answer.
yes, a k3 complete graph with each vertex has 2 degree each

19. Suppose that G is a graph with v vertices and e 
edges and that the degree of each vertex is at least 
dmin and at most dmax. Show that

1/2 dmin . v <= e <= 1/2dmax . v

break into 2:
1/2 dmin . v <= e
e <= 1/2 dmax .v

sum of degrees >= v . dmin
2e >= v . dmin
e >= 1/2v . dmin

e <= 1/2 dmax . v

21.

a. In a simple graph, must every vertex have 
degree that is less than the number of vertices 
in the graph? Why?
yes because if it's the total numbero f vertices instead of v-1,
it would involev a loop or parallel edge

b. can there be a simple graph that has four vertices of all different degres? why?
Noe because its impossible
proof:  so if theres 4 vertices
v1 = 0
v2 = 1
v3 = 2
v4 = 3
v4 would need to connect to v1 v2 and v3, but v1 needs to be 0 which is a condradiction

c. for any integer n >= 5, can there be a simple
graph that has n vertics all of different degrees? why?

vertices = 5
v1 = 0
v2 = 1
v3 = 2
v4 = 3
v5 = 4

since v5 needs to connect to all v1,v2,v3,and v4, 
this makes v1 contradict since it has 0/isolated edge therefore its impossible

22. In a group of two or more people, must there 
always be at least two people who are acquainted 
with the same number of people within the group? 
Why?

v => 2
degree of each v = 2
= ???


25. Suppose r and s are any positive integers. Does 
there exist a graph G with the property that G 
has vertices of degrees r and s and of no other 
degrees? Explain.
yes, it exists (k complete graph of k sr)
