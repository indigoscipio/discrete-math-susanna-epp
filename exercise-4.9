1. the total degree of a graph is defined as
answer: the total sum of degrees of all vertices

2. the handshake theorem states that the total degree of a graph is 
answer: equal to the number of edges of a graph

3. in any graph the number of vertices of odd degree is ___ 
answer: even (since 2 . odd = even)

4. a simple graph is
answer: a graph that does not have paralel edge or loop edge

5. a complete graph on n vertices is a 
answer: graph that has 1 edge connecting to all vertices

6. 
A complete bipartite graph on (m, n) vertices is a 
simple graph whose vertices can be divided into 
two distinct, non-overlapping sets, say V with m 
vertices and W with m vertices, in such a way that

(1) there is ___ from each vertex of V to each vertex of W,
(2) there is ___ from any one vertex of V to any other of V, and
(3) there is  ___ from any one vertex of W to any other vertex of W.

answer: 
1. one
2. no edge
3.no edge
