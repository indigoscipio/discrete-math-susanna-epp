1. the total degree of a graph is defined as
answer: the total sum of degrees of all vertices

2. the handshake theorem states that the total degree of a graph is 
answer: equal to the number of edges of a graph

3. in any graph the number of vertices of odd degree is ___ 
answer: even (since 2 . odd = even)

4. a simple graph is
answer: a graph that does not have paralel edge or loop edge

5. a complete graph on n vertices is a 
answer: graph that has 1 edge connecting to all vertices

6. 
A complete bipartite graph on (m, n) vertices is a 
simple graph whose vertices can be divided into 
two distinct, non-overlapping sets, say V with m 
vertices and W with m vertices, in such a way that

(1) there is ___ from each vertex of V to each vertex of W,
(2) there is ___ from any one vertex of V to any other of V, and
(3) there is  ___ from any one vertex of W to any other vertex of W.

answer: 
1. one
2. no edge
3.no edge

Exercise set 4.9

14. 
2p + 1p
5p + 2p
rest + 3p
15p knew each other (total edges)

a.how many people attending the party knew three other people before the party?
answer: 

2.1 + 5 . 2 + 3 . x
2 + 10 + 3x

12 + 3x
total degree = 2 . 15 = 30

12 + 3x = 30
3x = 30 - 12
3x = 18
x = 6
6 people knew three other people before the party

b.how many people attended the party?
answer: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13
