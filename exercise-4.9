1. the total degree of a graph is defined as
answer: the total sum of degrees of all vertices

2. the handshake theorem states that the total degree of a graph is 
answer: equal to the number of edges of a graph

3. in any graph the number of vertices of odd degree is ___ 
answer: even (since 2 . odd = even)

4. a simple graph is
answer: a graph that does not have paralel edge or loop edge

5. a complete graph on n vertices is a 
answer: graph that has 1 edge connecting to all vertices

6. 
A complete bipartite graph on (m, n) vertices is a 
simple graph whose vertices can be divided into 
two distinct, non-overlapping sets, say V with m 
vertices and W with m vertices, in such a way that

(1) there is ___ from each vertex of V to each vertex of W,
(2) there is ___ from any one vertex of V to any other of V, and
(3) there is  ___ from any one vertex of W to any other vertex of W.

answer: 
1. one
2. no edge
3.no edge

Exercise set 4.9

14. 
2p + 1p
5p + 2p
rest + 3p
15p knew each other (total edges)

a.how many people attending the party knew three other people before the party?
answer: 

2.1 + 5 . 2 + 3 . x
2 + 10 + 3x

12 + 3x
total degree = 2 . 15 = 30

12 + 3x = 30
3x = 30 - 12
3x = 18
x = 6
6 people knew three other people before the party

b.how many people attended the party?
answer: 2 + 5 + 6 = 13

15. action/degree = friends with
3p + 6p
1p + 5p
5p + 4p
rest + 3p
41 pairs of network friends (total edges)

a. how many people are network friends with three other people in the network?
answer

3.6 + 1.5 + 5.4 + x.3
18+5+20+3x
43+3x
total degree = 2.41 = 82

43+3x = 82
3x = 82 - 43
3x = 39
x = 13
13 people are network friends with three other people

b. how many people are in the network?
answer: 3+1+5+13 = 22 people

16.
a. In a group of 15 people, is it possible for each 
person to have exactly 3 friends? Justify your 
answer. (Assume that friendship is a symmet
ric relationship: If x is a friend of y, then y is a 
friend of x.)

vertex = 15
with 3 degree each
total degree = 15.3 = 45
since the total degree needs to be even therefore its impossible

b. in a group of 4 people, is it possible for each person to have exactly 3 friends?
vetex= 4
degree of each vertex = 3
4 . 3 = 12, so it's possible 

17. In a group of 25 people, is it possible for each to 
shake hands with exactly 3 other people? Justify 
your answer.
v = 25
degree of each vertex = 3
total degree = 25 . 3 = 75 = odd
therefore it's impossible

18. Is there a simple graph, each of whose vertices has 
even degree? Justify your answer.
yes, a k3 complete graph with each vertex has 2 degree each

19. Suppose that G is a graph with v vertices and e 
edges and that the degree of each vertex is at least 
dmin and at most dmax. Show that

1/2 dmin . v <= e <= 1/2dmax . v

break into 2:
1/2 dmin . v <= e
e <= 1/2 dmax .v

sum of degrees >= v . dmin
2e >= v . dmin
e >= 1/2v . dmin

e <= 1/2 dmax . v
