prove the statements in 1â€“11. In each case use only the 
definitions of the terms and the assumptions listed on 
page 161, not any previously established properties of 
odd and even integers. Follow the directions given in this 
section for writing proofs of universal statements.

 Assumptions:  In this text we assume a familiarity with the laws of basic algebra, which are listed 
in Appendix A. We also use the three properties of equality: For all objects A, B, and C, (1) A 5 A,
 (2) if A = B, then B = A, and (3) if A = B and B = C, then A = C.
 And we use the principle of substitution: For all objects A and B, if A 5 B, then 
we may substitute B wherever we have A.
 In addition, we assume that there is no integer between 0 and 1 and that the set of 
all integers is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This means 
that sums, differences, and products of integers are integers.

1. For every integer n, if n is odd then 3n+5 is even
Theorem: Ax integer n, if N is odd, then 3n+5 is even

Proof
Suppose n is any odd integer. [We must show that 3n+5 is even]

By the definition of odd, n = 2a+1 for some integer a
Then

3(2a+1) + 5 - by substitution
6a+8 - by algebra
2(3a+4)

let t = 3a+4, since product and addition of this is an integer, 2(3a+4) is an integer
Then by the definitino of even, 2(3a+4) is even. [As was to be shown]

2. For every integer m, if m is even then 3m+5 is odd
Theorem: Ax integer m, if m is even -> 3m+5 is odd

Proof
Suppose m is any [particular but arbitrary chosen] even integer. [we must show that 3m+5 is odd]
By the definition of even, m = 2a for some integer a

then
3(2a)+5 - by substitution
6a + 5 - by algebra
= 2(3a+2) + 1

Let t = 3a+2, since product of integer plus any integer is an integer, t is an integer
Then by the definition of odd, 2(3a+2) is odd [as was to be shown]


3. for every integer n, 2n-1 is odd
Theorem: Ax number n, if n is an integer -> 2n - 1 is odd

Proof:
Suppose n is any [particular but arbitrarily chosen] integer. [we must show that 2n-1 is odd]

Then
2n - 1 = 2(n - 1) + 1
Let t = (n - 1), since integer minus any integer is integer, t is an integer
Then by the definition of odd, 2(n-1) + 1 is odd [as was to be shown]


4. Theorem 4.2.2: The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd
Theorem: Ax integer m, Ax integer n, if m is even and n is odd, then m-n = odd

Proof:
Suppose m is any even integer, and n is any odd integer. [we must show that m - n is odd]
By the definition of odd, n = 2a + 1 for some integer a
By the definition of even, m = 2b for some integer b

2a - (2b + 1)
2(a-b) + 1

let t = (a - b). Since any integer minus any integer is an integer, t is also an integer
Then by thedefinition of odd, 2(a-b) + 1 is odd [ as was to be shown]


5.if a and b are any odd integers, then a^2 + b^2 is even.
Theorem: Ax integer a, Ax integer b, if a and b is odd integer, then a^2 + b^2 is even

Proof:
Suppose a is any odd integer, and b is any odd integer. [we must show that a^2 + b^2 is even]

By the definition of odd, a = 2x + 1 for some integer x
By the definition of odd, b = 2y + 1 for some integer y

Then
(2x+1)^2 + (2y+1)^2
= (4x^2 + 4x + 1) +  (4y^2 + 4y + 1)
= 4x^2 + 4x + 1 +  4y^2 + 4y + 1
= 4(x^2 + x + y^2 + y) + 2
= 2(2(x^2 + x + y^2 + y)+1)

let t = (2(x^2 + x + y^2 + y)+1). Since 2 times some integer is an integer, we can conclude t is also an integer
Then by definition of even, (2x+1)^2 + (2y+1)^2 is even. [as was to be shown]

6. if k is any odd integers and m is any even integers, then k^2 + m^2 is odd
Theorem: Ax integer k, Ax integer m, if k is odd and m is even -> k^2 + m^2 is odd
Proof: suppose k is any odd integer and m is any even integer. [We must show that k^2 + m^2 is odd]

By the definition of odd, k = 2a+1 for some integer a
by the definition of even, m = 2b for some integer B

Then
(2a + 1)^2 + (2b)^2
4a^2 + 4a + 4b^2 + 1
2(2a^2 + 2a + 2b^2) + 1

let t = (2a^2 + 2s + 2b^2). Since this evaluates to integer, we can conclude t is an integer
Then by the definition of odd, (2a + 1)^2 + (2b)^2 is odd [as was to be shown]

7. the diference between the squares of any two consecutive integers is odd
Theorem: Ax number a, Ax number b, if a and b is an integer -> a^2 - b^2 is odd

Proof: suppose a is an integer and b is an integer [we must show that a^2 - b^2 is odd]
By the definition of integer, a = n + 1 is n and b = n for some integer n


a^2 - b^2
(n+1)^2 - n^2
=n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2
= 2n + 1

since 2n + 1 is the definition of odd number, a^2 - b^2 is odd. [as was to be shown]

8. for any integers m and n, if m is even and n is odd then 5M+3n is odd
Proof: Ax integer m, Ax integer n, m is even and n is odd -> 5m+3n is odd

Suppose m is an even integer and n is an odd integer [we must show that 5M+3n is odd]
By the definition of even, m = 2a for some integer a
By the definition of odd, n = 2b + 1 for some integer b

Then
5(2a) + 3(2b + 1) - by substitution
10a + 6b + 3 - by algebra
2(5a + 3b + 1) + 1 - by factoring

let t = (5a + 3b + 1). Since integer plus other integer is also integer, t is an integer
By definitino of odd, 2t + 1 is odd [as was to be show]


9. if an integer greater than 4 is a perfect square, then the immediately preceding integer is not prime
Proof: Ax integer x, if x > 4 and perfect square -> imeediately preecing integer is not prime

Suppose x is an integer greater than 4 and a perfect square [we must show that the immediately proeceding integer is not prime]
x > 4 and x = n^2 for some integer n

x - 1 = n^2 - 1.
x - 1 = (n - 1) (n + 1)

find smallest possible value of N
n^2 > 4
n > 2
n >= 3

if we substitute (n - 1) and (n + 1) with n >= 3
ince x - 1 is always a product of two itnegers greater than 1, it cannot be prime.
by the definition of prime number, it must have exactly 1 and itself.
therefore, the imediately preceeding integer is not prime. [as was to be shown]

10. if n is any even integer, then (-1)^n = 1
Proof: Ax integer n, n is even -> (-1)^n = 1

Suppose n is an even integer [we must show that (-1)^n = 1 is even]
By the definition of even, n = 2a for some integer a

-1^2a
(-1(^2)^a)
1^a = 1

Therefore (-1)^n = 1 when n is even [as was to be shown]


11. if n is any odd integer, then (-1)^n = -1
Proof: Ax integer n, n is odd -> (-1)^n = -1

Suppose n is an odd integer [we must show (-1)^n = -1 is true when n is odd integer]
By the definition of odd, n = 2a + 1 for some integer a

-1^2a+1 = -1
= (-1)^2a (-1)^1
= ((-1)^2)^a . -1
= 1^a . -1
= 1 . -1
= -1

Therefore (-1)^n = -1 is true [as was to be shown]
