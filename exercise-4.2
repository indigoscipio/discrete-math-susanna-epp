prove the statements in 1–11. In each case use only the 
definitions of the terms and the assumptions listed on 
page 161, not any previously established properties of 
odd and even integers. Follow the directions given in this 
section for writing proofs of universal statements.

 Assumptions:  In this text we assume a familiarity with the laws of basic algebra, which are listed 
in Appendix A. We also use the three properties of equality: For all objects A, B, and C, (1) A 5 A,
 (2) if A = B, then B = A, and (3) if A = B and B = C, then A = C.
 And we use the principle of substitution: For all objects A and B, if A 5 B, then 
we may substitute B wherever we have A.
 In addition, we assume that there is no integer between 0 and 1 and that the set of 
all integers is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This means 
that sums, differences, and products of integers are integers.

1. For every integer n, if n is odd then 3n+5 is even
Theorem: Ax integer n, if N is odd, then 3n+5 is even

Proof
Suppose n is any odd integer. [We must show that 3n+5 is even]

By the definition of odd, n = 2a+1 for some integer a
Then

3(2a+1) + 5 - by substitution
6a+8 - by algebra
2(3a+4)

let t = 3a+4, since product and addition of this is an integer, 2(3a+4) is an integer
Then by the definitino of even, 2(3a+4) is even. [As was to be shown]

2. For every integer m, if m is even then 3m+5 is odd
Theorem: Ax integer m, if m is even -> 3m+5 is odd

Proof
Suppose m is any [particular but arbitrary chosen] even integer. [we must show that 3m+5 is odd]
By the definition of even, m = 2a for some integer a

then
3(2a)+5 - by substitution
6a + 5 - by algebra
= 2(3a+2) + 1

Let t = 3a+2, since product of integer plus any integer is an integer, t is an integer
Then by the definition of odd, 2(3a+2) is odd [as was to be shown]


3. for every integer n, 2n-1 is odd
Theorem: Ax number n, if n is an integer -> 2n - 1 is odd

Proof:
Suppose n is any [particular but arbitrarily chosen] integer. [we must show that 2n-1 is odd]

Then
2n - 1 = 2(n - 1) + 1
Let t = (n - 1), since integer minus any integer is integer, t is an integer
Then by the definition of odd, 2(n-1) + 1 is odd [as was to be shown]


4. Theorem 4.2.2: The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd
Theorem: Ax integer m, Ax integer n, if m is even and n is odd, then m-n = odd

Proof:
Suppose m is any even integer, and n is any odd integer. [we must show that m - n is odd]
By the definition of odd, n = 2a + 1 for some integer a
By the definition of even, m = 2b for some integer b

2a - (2b + 1)
2(a-b) + 1

let t = (a - b). Since any integer minus any integer is an integer, t is also an integer
Then by thedefinition of odd, 2(a-b) + 1 is odd [ as was to be shown]


5.if a and b are any odd integers, then a^2 + b^2 is even.
Theorem: Ax integer a, Ax integer b, if a and b is odd integer, then a^2 + b^2 is even

Proof:
Suppose a is any odd integer, and b is any odd integer. [we must show that a^2 + b^2 is even]

By the definition of odd, a = 2x + 1 for some integer x
By the definition of odd, b = 2y + 1 for some integer y

Then
(2x+1)^2 + (2y+1)^2
= (4x^2 + 4x + 1) +  (4y^2 + 4y + 1)
= 4x^2 + 4x + 1 +  4y^2 + 4y + 1
= 4(x^2 + x + y^2 + y) + 2
= 2(2(x^2 + x + y^2 + y)+1)

let t = (2(x^2 + x + y^2 + y)+1). Since 2 times some integer is an integer, we can conclude t is also an integer
Then by definition of even, (2x+1)^2 + (2y+1)^2 is even. [as was to be shown]

6. if k is any odd integers and m is any even integers, then k^2 + m^2 is odd
Theorem: Ax integer k, Ax integer m, if k is odd and m is even -> k^2 + m^2 is odd
Proof: suppose k is any odd integer and m is any even integer. [We must show that k^2 + m^2 is odd]

By the definition of odd, k = 2a+1 for some integer a
by the definition of even, m = 2b for some integer B

Then
(2a + 1)^2 + (2b)^2
4a^2 + 4a + 4b^2 + 1
2(2a^2 + 2a + 2b^2) + 1

let t = (2a^2 + 2s + 2b^2). Since this evaluates to integer, we can conclude t is an integer
Then by the definition of odd, (2a + 1)^2 + (2b)^2 is odd [as was to be shown]

7. the diference between the squares of any two consecutive integers is odd
Theorem: Ax number a, Ax number b, if a and b is an integer -> a^2 - b^2 is odd

Proof: suppose a is an integer and b is an integer [we must show that a^2 - b^2 is odd]
By the definition of integer, a = n + 1 is n and b = n for some integer n


a^2 - b^2
(n+1)^2 - n^2
=n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2
= 2n + 1

since 2n + 1 is the definition of odd number, a^2 - b^2 is odd. [as was to be shown]

8. for any integers m and n, if m is even and n is odd then 5M+3n is odd
Proof: Ax integer m, Ax integer n, m is even and n is odd -> 5m+3n is odd

Suppose m is an even integer and n is an odd integer [we must show that 5M+3n is odd]
By the definition of even, m = 2a for some integer a
By the definition of odd, n = 2b + 1 for some integer b

Then
5(2a) + 3(2b + 1) - by substitution
10a + 6b + 3 - by algebra
2(5a + 3b + 1) + 1 - by factoring

let t = (5a + 3b + 1). Since integer plus other integer is also integer, t is an integer
By definitino of odd, 2t + 1 is odd [as was to be show]


9. if an integer greater than 4 is a perfect square, then the immediately preceding integer is not prime
Proof: Ax integer x, if x > 4 and perfect square -> imeediately preecing integer is not prime

Suppose x is an integer greater than 4 and a perfect square [we must show that the immediately proeceding integer is not prime]
x > 4 and x = n^2 for some integer n

x - 1 = n^2 - 1.
x - 1 = (n - 1) (n + 1)

find smallest possible value of N
n^2 > 4
n > 2
n >= 3

if we substitute (n - 1) and (n + 1) with n >= 3
ince x - 1 is always a product of two itnegers greater than 1, it cannot be prime.
by the definition of prime number, it must have exactly 1 and itself.
therefore, the imediately preceeding integer is not prime. [as was to be shown]

10. if n is any even integer, then (-1)^n = 1
Proof: Ax integer n, n is even -> (-1)^n = 1

Suppose n is an even integer [we must show that (-1)^n = 1 is even]
By the definition of even, n = 2a for some integer a

-1^2a
(-1(^2)^a)
1^a = 1

Therefore (-1)^n = 1 when n is even [as was to be shown]


11. if n is any odd integer, then (-1)^n = -1
Proof: Ax integer n, n is odd -> (-1)^n = -1

Suppose n is an odd integer [we must show (-1)^n = -1 is true when n is odd integer]
By the definition of odd, n = 2a + 1 for some integer a

-1^2a+1 = -1
= (-1)^2a (-1)^1
= ((-1)^2)^a . -1
= 1^a . -1
= 1 . -1
= -1

Therefore (-1)^n = -1 is true [as was to be shown]

Prove that the statements in 12 - 14 are flase.
12.There exists an integer m >= 3 such that m^2 -1 is prime
Proof: Ax integer m, if m >= 3 -> m^2 - 1 is prime

Suppose m is integer greater than or equal to 3 [we must show that m^2 - 1 is prime is false]
m >= 3

m^2 - 1
= (m - 1) (m + 1)

(3 - 1) (3 + 1)
2 4

By thede finition of prime, the difference of squares need to have 1 and itself
since m - 1 and m + 1 are both greater than 1 when m >= 3
therefore m^2 - 1 can never be prime for m >= 3 [as was to be shown]

13. There exists an integer n such that 6n^2 + 27 is prime
Proof: Ax number n,  n is an integer -> 6n^2 + 27 is prime

Suppose n is an integer [we must show that 6n^2 + 27 is prime is not true]

6n^2 + 27
3(2n^2 + 9)

For 6n^2 + 27 o be prime, one of the factor must be 1 and the other must be a number itself
owever, 3 is a factor greater than 1 and (2n^2 + 9) is also greater than 1 which means it cannot be prime.
[as was to be shown]


14. there exists an integer k >= 4 such that 2k^2 - 5k + 2 is prime
proof: Ax integer k, if k >= 4 -> 2k^2 - 5k is a prime

suppose k is an integer greater or equal to 4 [we must show  2k^2 - 5k is a prime is not true]

k = >= 4
2k^2 - 5k + 2

ac = 4
multiple to +4
add to -5
(-1, -4)

(2k^2 - 4k - k + 2)
(2k^2-4k) + (-k + 2)
2k(k - 2) -1(k - 2)
(2k - 1) (k - 2)

let k - 4
8 - 1 . 2

The statement is false because the two factors does not follow the rule of prime number (prime number must have factor of 1 and itself)
Since two factors can never be 1 or itself (with k >= 4), we can conclude that the statement is false [as was to be shown]

Find the mistakes in the “proofs” shown in 15–19.
15. Theorem: For every integer k, if k > 0 then k^2 + 2k + 1 is composite.

Proof: for k = 2, k > 0 and k^2 + 2k + 1 = 2^2 + 2 . 2 + 1 = 9
And since 9 = 3 . 3, then 9 is composite, hence the theorem is true

Mistake:
The proof is incorrect becasue it only picks for k/single value instead of every integer greater than 0
It does not check wheter k^2 + 2k + 1 is always composite
Then it concludes that 9 is composite without stating what makes a number composite.

16. Theorem: the differnece between any odd integer and any even integers is odd
Proof: Suppose n is any odd integer, and m is any even integer.
By definition of odd, n = 2k+1 where k is an integer
and by definition of even, m=2k where k is an integer.

Then n - m = (2k+1) - 2k = 1,

and 1 is odd. 
Therefore, the difference between any odd integer and any even integer is odd.

Mistake:
The proof incorrectly reuses the same variable k for both n amd m when it should have sperate integer
leading to incorrect conclusion.

17. For every integer k, if k > 0 then k^2 + 2k + 1 is composite

Proof: Suppose k is any integer such that k > 0. 
If k^2 + 2k + 1 is composite, then k^2 + 2k + 1 = rs for some integers r and s such that


1 < r < k^2 + 2k + 1
and
1 < s < k^2 + 2k + 1

since k^2 + 2k + 1 = rs
and both r and s are strictly between 1 and k^2 + 2k + 1, then k^2 + 2k + 1 is not prime

This proof is incorrect because it tries prove the answer itself from the definition of composite
and gives assumption that the result is not prime. It does not show that k^2 + 2k + 1 = rs is composite or not
It does not find r and s and wheter there is factor or not

18. Theorem: The product of any even integer and any odd integer is even

Proof: Suppose m is any even integer and n is any odd integer.
If m . n is even, then by definition of even there exists an integer r such that m . n = 2r.
Also since m is even, there exists an in teger p such that m = 2p,
and since n is odd there exists an integer q such that n = 2q + 1.

Thus  mn = (2p)(2q+1) = 2r,

Where r is an integer.
By definition of even, then, m . n is even, as was to be shown.”

Mistake: this proof establishes an incorrect definition/variable r and led to an incorrect conclusion
It assumes m . n is even instead of proving it step by step

19. Theorem: the sum of any two even integers equal 4k for some integer k
Proof: Suppose m and n are any two even integers.
By definition of even, m = 2k for some integer k and n = 2k for some integer k.

By substitution, m + n = 2k + 2k = 4k

This is what was to be shown

Mistake: the proof is incorrect because it uses the same variable for both m and n,
thus leds to a wrong conclusion

 In 20–38 determine whether the statement is true or 
false. Justify your answer with a proof or a counterexam
ple, as appropriate. In each case use only the definitions 
of the terms and the assumptions listed on page 161, not 
any previously established properties.

20. The product of any two odd integers is odd
Theorem: Ax integer a, Ax integer b, if a and b is odd -> a x b is odd

Proof:
Suppose a and b are any particular odd integer [we must show a x b is odd]
By the definition of odd, a = 2k + 1 for some integer k
By the definition of odd, b = 2m + 1 for some integer m

(2k + 1) * (2m + 1)
4km + 2k + 2m + 1
2(2km + k + m) + 1

let t = (km + k +m), since any integer plus any integer times any integer, t is also integer
Thus by the definition of odd, 2t + 1 is odd [as was to be shown]
Therefore this statement is correct as proven

21. The negative of any odd integer is odd
Theorem: Ax integer n, if n is odd -> -n is odd
Suppose n is any particular odd integer [we must show -n is odd]

By the definition of odd, a = 2k + 1 for some integer k

-n = -(2k + 1)
= -2k -1
= 2(-k - 1) + 1

Let t = (-k - 1). Since any integer minus any integer is integer, t is an integer
By the definitino of odd, -(2k+1) is odd [as was to be shown]

22. For all integers a and b, 4a + 5b + 3 is even
Theorem: Ax number a, Ax number b, if a and b is integer -> 4a + 5b + 3 is even
Suppose a and b is any particular integer [we must show that 4a + 5b + 3 is even]

4a + 5b + 3
4a = 2(2a) -> even number
5b = odd but edpends if its even or odd. If it's odd then its also odd, if its even it's also even 
3 = odd constant

Therefore the expreesion is not always even. It is only even only if b is odd
Therefore the statement is false.

23. The product of any even integer and any integer is even
Theorem: Ax integer a, Ax integer b, if a is even -> a * b is even

Suppose a is any even integer and b is any integer [we must show a * b is even]
By the definition of even, a = 2k for some integer k

2k * b
= 2 (k b)

let t = k . b . since any integer times any integer is an integer therefore t is an integer
Since 2(kb) follows the definition of even number, a * b is even [as was to be shown]
therefore the statement is correct

24. If the sum of two integers is even, then one of the summands is even
(In the expression a + b, and and b are called summands)

Theorem: Ax integer a, Ax integer b, a + b is even -> a or b is even
Contrapositive: Ax integer a, Ax integer b, a or b is odd AND a + b is not even

proof: Suppose a and b is any particular integer [we must show that a or b is odd and a + b is not even]
By the definition of odd, a = 2k + 1 for some integer k
By the definition of odd, b = 2m + 1 for some integer m

2k + 1 + 2m + 1
2k + 2m + 2
2(k + m + 1)

We found a case where both summands were odd, yet their sum was even, therefore the original statement is false [as was to be shown]

25. The difference of any two even integers is even
Ax integer a, Ax integer b, if a and b is even -> a - b is even

suppose a and b is any particular even integer [we must show that  a - b is even]
By the definition of even, a = 2k for some integer k
By the definition of even, b = 2m for some integer m

a - b
= 2k - 2m
= 2(k - m)

Let t = (k - m) since difference is integer is integer, t is also an integer
therefore 2(k - m) is even by the definition of even [as was to be shown]
therfore the statement is true


26. For all integers a, b and c, if a, b and c are consecutive, then a + b + c is even

Supose a, b, and c is any particular integer [we must show that a + b + c is even if a, b, and c are consecutive]

(n) + (n + 1) + (n + 2)
3n + 3
3(n + 1)

we know 3 and 1 is odd, so

if n is odd = odd (odd + odd) = odd (even) = even
if n is even = odd (even + odd) = odd (odd) = odd

since a + b + c = 3(n +1) is not always even (depends if n is odd or evn), the statement is false
[as was to be shown]

27. the differnec of any two odd integers is even
Ax integer a, Ax integer b, if a and b is odd integer -> a - b is even

Suppose a and b is any particular odd integer [we must show a - b is even]
By the definition of odd, a = 2k + 1 for some integer k
By the definition of odd, b = 2m + 1 for some integer m

(2k + 1) - (2m + 1)
2k - 2m
2(k - m)

Let t = (k - m) since difference is integer is integer, t is also an integer
therefore 2(k - m) is even by the definition of even [as was to be shown]
therfore the statement is true

28. For all integers n and m, if n - m is even then n^3 - m^3 is even
Ax integer n, Ax integer m, if n - m is even -> n^3 - m^3 is even

Suppose n and m is any particular integer [we must show if n - m is even, then n^3 - m^3 is even]
By the definition of even,

n - m = 2k for some integer k
(n - m)(n^2 + nm + m^2)
= 2 k(n^2 + nm + m^2)
Let t = k(n^2 + nm + m^2), since 2 times some integer is itneger, t is also an integer
from yhe definition of even,  n^3 - m^3 is even [as to be shown]

29. for every integer n, if n is prime then (-1)^n = -1
Ax integer n, if n is prime -> (-1)^n = -1
Suppose n is any particular integer [we must show that (-1)^n = -1 if n is prime]

-(1)^n = -1

if n is odd, then -(1)^n = -1 -> n = 2
if n is even, then -(1)^n = 1 -> the other remaiing prime numbers

The theorem is false because (-1)^n = -1  is not always true for all prime numbers (number 2)
[as was to be shown]

30. For every integer m, if m > 2 then m^2 - 4 is composite
Suppose m is any particular integer [we must show m^2 - 4 is composite if m > 2 ]

m > 2
let m  = 3

m^2 - 4
9 - 4  = 5 (not a composite)

Since we found a counterexampel above, the given statement is false when m = 3
therefore its not always composite [as to be shown]

31. for every integer n, n^2 - n + 11 is a prime number
Suppose n is any particular integer [we must show n^2 - n + 11 is a prime number ] 


let n = 0
1 - 0 + 11 = 12 (not prime)

Since we found a counterexample in case of n = 0 is not prime, therefore the statement is false
[as was to be shown

32. For every integer n, 4(n^2+n+1) - 3n^2 is a perfect square
Suppose n is any particular integer [we must show that  4(n^2+n+1) - 3n^2 is a perfect square ]

 4(n^2+n+1) - 3n^2 
 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 - 3n^2
 = n^2 + 4n + 1

 (n + k)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 1
 n^2 + 2kn + k^2 = n^2 + 4n + 1
 2kn + k^2 = 4n + 1

 Since theres no value that can satisfy this, therefore the statement is false [as was to be shown]
 
 33. Every positive integer can be xpressed as a sum of three or fewer perfect squares
 Suppose n is any particular positive integer [we must show that n can be expressed as sum of three or fewer perfect squares]

n = positive integer
let n = 1
n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2
1 = 1^1
2 = 1^1 + 1^1
