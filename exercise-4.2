answer: complete, gramatically correct

3. every assertion in a proof should be suported by a ___
answer: reason/logic

4. the following are some useful little words and phrases that clarify the reasoning in a proof:
____, ____, ____, ____, and ____.
answer: thus, we can conclude, therefore, we have shown that, because, consequently, it it follows, by substitution

5. a new thought or fact that does not follow as an immediate consequence of the preceeding statement can be

answer: let

7. displaying equations and inequalities increases the ____ of a proof

8. some proof writing mistakes are ____, ____, ____, ____, ____,___ and ____
answer: jumping to conclusion, misuse of the word if, mistaken any and some, confusing what's known and what's to be known
arguing from example, using same letter to mean two diferent thing, assuing what's to be proved

prove the statements in 1â€“11. In each case use only the 
definitions of the terms and the assumptions listed on 
page 161, not any previously established properties of 
odd and even integers. Follow the directions given in this 
section for writing proofs of universal statements.

 Assumptions:  In this text we assume a familiarity with the laws of basic algebra, which are listed 
in Appendix A. We also use the three properties of equality: For all objects A, B, and C, (1) A 5 A,
 (2) if A = B, then B = A, and (3) if A = B and B = C, then A = C.
 And we use the principle of substitution: For all objects A and B, if A 5 B, then 
we may substitute B wherever we have A.
 In addition, we assume that there is no integer between 0 and 1 and that the set of 
all integers is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This means 
that sums, differences, and products of integers are integers.

1. For every integer n, if n is odd then 3n+5 is even
Theorem: Ax integer n, if N is odd, then 3n+5 is even

Proof
Suppose n is any odd integer. [We must show that 3n+5 is even]

By the definition of odd, n = 2a+1 for some integer a
Then

3(2a+1) + 5 - by substitution
6a+8 - by algebra
2(3a+4)

let t = 3a+4, since product and addition of this is an integer, 2(3a+4) is an integer
Then by the definitino of even, 2(3a+4) is even. [As was to be shown]

2. For every integer m, if m is even then 3m+5 is odd

3. for every integer n, 2n-1 is odd

4. Theorem 4.2.2: The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd

5.if a and b are any odd integers, then a^2 + b^2 is even.

6. if k is any odd integers, then k^2 + m^2 is odd

7. the diference between the squares of any two consecutive integers is odd

8. for any integers m and n, if m is even and n is odd then 5M+3n is odd

9. if an integer greater than 4 is a perfect square, then the immediately preceding integer is not prime

10. if n is any even integer, then (-1)^n = 1

11. if n is any odd integer, then (-1)^n = -1

Prove that the statements in 12 - 14 are flase.
