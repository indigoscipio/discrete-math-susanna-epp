1. In the comparison between the structure of the 
set of statement forms and the set of subsets of a 
universal set,
the or operation V corresponds to union
the and operation A corresponds to intersec
the tautoogy t corresponds to Universal
the contradiction c corresponds to empty set
the negation operation ~ corresponds to complement

2. the oeprations of + and . in boolean algebra are eneralizations of the operations
V and A in the set of all statement forms ina given finite number of variables and the operations of
or and and in the set of all subsets of a given sets.

3. the set of all sets that are not elements of themselves


exercise set 6.4
1. idempotent law for .:
for every a in B, a . a = a
proof: let a be any elemenet of B, then

a = a . 1 (a)
= a . (a + a') (b)
= (a . a) + (a . a') c
= (a . a) + 0 d
= a . a e

answer:
a. by identity law of .
b. by the complement law of +
c. by the distributive law for . over +
d. by the identiy law for .
e. by the identity law of +

2. universal bound law for + :
for every a n B, a + 1 = 1
proof: let a be any element of B, then
a+1 = a + (a+a') a
= (a+a) + a' b
= a + a' by example 6.4.2
= 1 c

answer:
a. by the complement law for +
b. by associative law
c. by idempotent law

3. absorption law for . over +:
for all a and b in B, (a + b) . a = a
proof: let a be any elemnt of B. then
(a + b) . a = a . (a + b) (a)
= a . a + a . b (b)
= a + a . b by exercise 1
= a . 1 + a . b (c)
= a . (1 + b) (d)
= a . (b + 1) (e)
= a . 1 by exercise 2
= a (f)

answer:
a) by commutative law
b) by distributive law of . over +
c) by identity law of .
d) by distributive law of . over +
e) by commutative law
f) by identity law of .

in 4 - 10 assume that B is a boolean algebra with operations + and .
prove each statement using only the axioms for boolean algebra and statement proved
in the text or in lower numbered exericses.

4. universal bound for 0: for every a in B, a . 0 = 0.
answer:
a . 0 = 0.
= (a + 0) . 0 by identity law for +
= 0 . (a + 0) by commutative law
= (0 . a) + (0 . 0) by distributive law
= ((a . a') . a) + 0 by complemetn law and  idempotent law
= a . (a' . a) + 0 by associateive law
= a . a . a' + 0 by associative law
= a . a' + 0 by idempotent lwa
= 0 + 0 by complement law
= 0 by idempottent law

5. complements of 0 and 1:
a. 0' = 1
b. 1' = 0

6. uniqueness of 0: there is only one element of B that is an identity for +

step 1
assume x is an identity for +
by definition, a + x = a for all a E B

step 2
choose special case a = 0
0 + x = 0

step 3
we know 0 is an identity for + so
x + 0 = x

step 4. by commutative law, 0 + x = x + 0
comebine: x = x + 0 = 0 + x = 0, therefore + identity is unique


7. uniqueness of 1: there is only one element of B that is an identity for .

step 1
assume x is an identity for .
by definition, a . x = a for all a E B

step 2
choose special case a = 1

step 3
but we know 1 is an identity for . so
a . 1 = a

step 4 by commutatiev law, 1 . x = x . 1
combine: x = x . 1 = 1 . x  therefore idnetity is unique

8. de morgans law for +: for all a and b in B, (a+b)' = a' . b'

(a+b)' = a' . b'
by compleemnt law,
a + a' = 1 and
a . a' = 0

let x =
