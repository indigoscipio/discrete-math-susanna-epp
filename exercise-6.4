1. In the comparison between the structure of the 
set of statement forms and the set of subsets of a 
universal set,
the or operation V corresponds to union
the and operation A corresponds to intersec
the tautoogy t corresponds to Universal
the contradiction c corresponds to empty set
the negation operation ~ corresponds to complement

2. the oeprations of + and . in boolean algebra are eneralizations of the operations
V and A in the set of all statement forms ina given finite number of variables and the operations of
or and and in the set of all subsets of a given sets.

3. the set of all sets that are not elements of themselves


exercise set 6.4
1. idempotent law for .:
for every a in B, a . a = a
proof: let a be any elemenet of B, then

a = a . 1 (a)
= a . (a + a') (b)
= (a . a) + (a . a') c
= (a . a) + 0 d
= a . a e

answer:
a. by identity law of .
b. by the complement law of +
c. by the distributive law for . over +
d. by the identiy law for .
e. by the identity law of +

2. universal bound law for + :
for every a n B, a + 1 = 1
proof: let a be any element of B, then
a+1 = a + (a+a') a
= (a+a) + a' b
= a + a' by example 6.4.2
= 1 c

answer:
a. by the complement law for +
b. by commutative law
c. by idempotent law
