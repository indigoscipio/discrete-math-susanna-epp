The ancient greeks discovered that in a right triangle where both legs have length 1,
the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse
to the length of one of the legs is not equal to a ration of ___
answer: two integers

2. one way to prove that sqrt(2) is an irrational number is to
assume that sqrt(2) = m/n for some integers m and n that have no common
factor greater than 1, use the lemma that says that if the square of an integer
is even then ___, and eventually show that m and n __
answer: the integer is even, it has 2 as a common factor

3. one way to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers is to assume that there is a largest prime number p,
construct the number ___, and then show that this number has to be divisible by a prime number that is greater than __
answer: p1,p2,p3,p...p , p


Exercise set 4.8
1. a calculator display shows that sqrt(2) = 1.414213562
because 1.414213562 = 1.414213562 /  1000000000
this suggests that sqrt(2) is a rational number which contradicts theorem 4.8.1
explain the discrepency

answer: i think this is because the way calculator works it calculates to a certain digit? eg approximation?
it cannot represent infinite number so its limited


2. Example 4.3.1(h) illustrates a technique for show
ing that any repeating decimal number is rational. 
A calculator display shows the result of a certain 
calculation as 40.72727272727. Can you be sure 
that the result of the calculation is a rational num
ber? Explain.

Following the steps of example 4.3.1h
let x = 0.72727272
100x = 72.72727272

100x - x = 72.727272-0.727272 = 72
but also 100x-x = 99x
hence 99x = 72
x = 72/99

threfore it can be expressed as a rational number because its a ratio of two integers and the denominator does not equal 0

3. could there be a rational number whose first trillion digits are the same as the first trillion digits of sqrt(2)?
answer: yes, it is possible because we can find ways to represent trillion digits as rational number until the trillionth digits,
but after that the digits would diverge (because ratioanl number will never be infinite and vice versa)

4. a calculator display shows that the result of a certain calculation is 0.2
can you be sure the result of the calculation is a rational number?
answer: yes because we can represent 0.2 as 2/10, 0.2 does not have inf

5.  Let S be the statement:

The cube root of every irrational number is irrational.
This statement is true, but the following “proof” is incorrect.
Explain the mistake.

 “Proof (by contradiction):
 Suppose not.  Suppose the cube root of every irrational number is rational
 But 2sqrt(2) is irrational because it is a product of a rational and an irrational number, 
 and the cube root of 2sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), which is irrational.
 
 This is a contradiction, and hence it is not true that the cube root of every irrational number is rational.
 Thus the statement to be proved is true.”

 answer:
 negation: Ex number i, i is irrational, cube root of i is rational 
 correct negation: There The cube root of some irrational number is rational
