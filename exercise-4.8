The ancient greeks discovered that in a right triangle where both legs have length 1,
the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse
to the length of one of the legs is not equal to a ration of ___
answer: two integers

2. one way to prove that sqrt(2) is an irrational number is to
assume that sqrt(2) = m/n for some integers m and n that have no common
factor greater than 1, use the lemma that says that if the square of an integer
is even then ___, and eventually show that m and n __
answer: the integer is even, it has 2 as a common factor

3. one way to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers is to assume that there is a largest prime number p,
construct the number ___, and then show that this number has to be divisible by a prime number that is greater than __
answer: p1,p2,p3,p...p , p


Exercise set 4.8
1. a calculator display shows that sqrt(2) = 1.414213562
because 1.414213562 = 1.414213562 /  1000000000
this suggests that sqrt(2) is a rational number which contradicts theorem 4.8.1
explain the discrepency

answer: i think this is because the way calculator works it calculates to a certain digit? eg approximation?
it cannot represent infinite number so its limited


2. Example 4.3.1(h) illustrates a technique for show
ing that any repeating decimal number is rational. 
A calculator display shows the result of a certain 
calculation as 40.72727272727. Can you be sure 
that the result of the calculation is a rational num
ber? Explain.

Following the steps of example 4.3.1h
let x = 0.72727272
100x = 72.72727272

100x - x = 72.727272-0.727272 = 72
but also 100x-x = 99x
hence 99x = 72
x = 72/99

threfore it can be expressed as a rational number because its a ratio of two integers and the denominator does not equal 0

3. could there be a rational number whose first trillion digits are the same as the first trillion digits of sqrt(2)?
answer: yes, it is possible because we can find ways to represent trillion digits as rational number until the trillionth digits,
but after that the digits would diverge (because ratioanl number will never be infinite and vice versa)

4. a calculator display shows that the result of a certain calculation is 0.2
can you be sure the result of the calculation is a rational number?
answer: yes because we can represent 0.2 as 2/10, 0.2 does not have inf

5.  Let S be the statement:

The cube root of every irrational number is irrational.
This statement is true, but the following “proof” is incorrect.
Explain the mistake.

 “Proof (by contradiction):
 Suppose not.  Suppose the cube root of every irrational number is rational
 But 2sqrt(2) is irrational because it is a product of a rational and an irrational number, 
 and the cube root of 2sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), which is irrational.
 
 This is a contradiction, and hence it is not true that the cube root of every irrational number is rational.
 Thus the statement to be proved is true.”

 answer:
 negation: Ex number i, i is irrational, cube root of i is rational 
 correct negation: There The cube root of some irrational number is rational


 determine which statements in 6 - 16 are true and which are false.
 Prove those that are true and disprove those that are false.

6. 6 - 7sqrt(2) is irrational
answer: true because integer - irrational is irrational
proof by contradiction: suppose 6 - 7sqrt(2) is rational, call it q
so 6 - 7sqrt(2)= q
sqrt(2) = q-6/7
q-6 is rational and q-6/7 is also rational because 7 does not equal 0
which means sqrt2 must be a rational number
contradiction is found and therefore the original statement is true

7. 3sqrt(2) - 7 is irrational
true because irrational - integer is irrational

proof by contradiction:
suppose 3sqrt(2)-7 is rational, call it r
so 3sqrt(2)-7 = r

now we solve for sqrt(2)
sqrt(2) = r+7/3
we know that r is rational and r+7 is also rational since rational + rational = rational
3 is also nonzero threfore sqrt(2) has the form of rational number
but this is a contradiction because sqrt(2) is rational therefore original statmenet is true
 

8.sqrt(4) is irrational
false because sqrt 4 is 2 which is integer
you can solve sqrt(4) = 2 where 2 is an integer (this is the counterexample)

9. sqrt(2)/6 is irrational
true because irrational / integer = irrational
proof by contradiction: sqrt(2)/6 is rational
[we must deduce contradiction]

sqrt(2)/6 = q
sqrt(2) = 6q
therefore 6q is rational since 6 . rational = rational
but sqrt(2) is irrational and therefore this i sthe contradiction


10. the sum of any two irrational numbers is irrational
answer: the statement is false 
coutnerexample: sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2)
their sum is 0

11. the difference of any two irrational numbers is irrational
answer: the statement is false
counterexample: sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) = 0
their difference is 0

12. the positive square root of a positive irrational number is irrational
answer:

positive irrational number n where n > 0
sqrt(2) = irrational
sqrt(pi) = irrational

generalized proof
proof by contradiction
Suppose not. that is, suppose There exists a positive irrational number n such that  n  is not rational.

[We must deduce a contradiction.]
sqrt(n) = q where q is rational
square both sides
n = q^2
we know that q^2 is rational since rational^2 is rational therefore n is rational
but this is a contradiction because we supposed positive square root to be irrational
therefore we found a contradiction and the original statement is true


13. if r is any rational nubmer and s is any irrational number, then r/s is irrational
answer: let r = 0/1 (0) and s = sqrt(2)
r/s = 0/sqrt(2) = 0 (rational)
therefore the counterexample is found

14. the sum of any two positive irrational number is irratinal
answer: 

let i = positive irrational, q = irrational
i + q = positive  irrational number s

1 + sqrt(2) + 2 - sqrt(2) = 3 + 0 = 3
therefore a counterexamle is found

15. the product of two irrational numbers is irrational
counterexample:
let i and r both irrational number
i = sqrt(2)
r = sqrt(2)
sqrt(2) . sqrt(2) = 2 which is an integer
therefore the original statement is false and the counterexample is found

16. if an integer greater than 1 is a perfect square, then its cube root is irrational
Ax integer n where n > 1, if n is a perfect square, cuberoot(n) is irrational
let s = perfect square where s > 1
let c = cuberoot(s)

s = 4 -> cuberoot(4) = irrational
seems to be true, move to generalized proof

prof by contradiction
negation: Ex itneger n where n > 1, n is a perfect square and cuberoot(n) is rational
Suppose Not, that is ,supppose there exists a integer n where n > 1, n is a perfect square and cuberoot(n) is rational

cuberoot(n) = q where q is rational
cube all side
n = q^3 therefore q is rational number because q.q.q is rational

k^2 = a^3/b^3
k^2b^3 = a^3

17.  Consider the following sentence:
If x is rational then sqrt(x) is irrational.
Is this sentence always true, sometimes true and sometimes false, or always false? Justify your answer.


let x = 4/1 (4)
sqrt(4) = 2 which is rational (2/1)
therefore the stentence above is false since we found a counterexample
so its sometimes true and false depending on the input.

18. a. prove that for every integer a, if a^3 is even then a is even
answer: 
let a = 2
2^3 = 8 -> even
let a = 4
4^3 = 64 -> even

the pattern seems to be true, now for general proof
proof by contradiction
negation: for some integer a, a^3 is even and a is odd
Suppose not. That is, sppose there exists some integer a such that a^3 is even and a is odd [we must deduce a contradiction]

let a = 2k + 1

a^3 = (2k+1)^3
= (2k+1) (2k+1) (2k+1)
= (4k^2 + 4k + 1) (2k + 1)
= (8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1)
= 2 (4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1

there fore a^3 is odd since it has the form 2 . some integer but this is a contradiction since we assumed a^3 is even at the begining
therefore the contradiction is proven and te original statmenet is true

b. prove that cuberoot(2) is irrational
proof by contradiction
negation: cuberoot(2) is rational
Suppose not. that is, suppose that the cuberoot(2) is rational

cuberoot(2) = r for some rational number r
r = a/b by the definition of rational a and b is integer and b is nonzero

cuberoot(2) = m/n -> where m/n has no common factors other than 1
cube the two side to get rid of the cube root
2 = m^3 / n^3
2n^3 = m^3
m^3 = 2n^3

this means m^3 is an even number since it has the form 2 . some integer
therefore m is even -> m = 2k

wk^3 = 2n^3
8k^3 = 2n^3
4k^3 = n^3
n^3 = 2(2k)^3
therefore n^2 is also even

but this is a contradiction because m and n is both even which means it has 2 as factor
and we assumed at the beginning that rational number has no other common factor other than 1
[threfore the contradiciton is proven and the original statemnet is tre]

19. a. use proof by conttradiction to show that for any integer n,
it is impossible for n to equal both 3q1 + r1 and 3q2 + r2 where q1, q2, r1, and r2 are integers,
0 <= r1 < 3, 0 <= r2 < 3 and r1 does not equal r2

proof by contradiction.
suppose not. that is, suppose there exists an integer n such that n = 3q+1 and 3q2 + r2 where q1,q2, r1, and r2 are integer,
and 0 <= r1 < 3, 0 <= r2 < 3 and r1 does not equal r2

3q1 + r1 = 3q2 + r2

r1 - r2 = 3q2 - 3q1
r1 - r2 = 3 (q2 - q1)

this means r1 - r2 must be a multiple of 3

possible pair = {0,1,2}
none of these numbers is a multiple of 3
therefore we found the contradiction [and the origianl statment istrue]

b. use proof by contradiction, quotient rminder theorem division into cases and the result of part a to prove
that for any integer n, if n^2 is divisible by 3, then n is divisible by 3

prof by contradiction:
negation: For some integer n, n^2 is divisible by 3 and n is not divisible by 3
suppoe not. that is, suppoe that  For some integer n, n^2 is divisible by 3 and n is not divisible by 3
[we must deduce a contradiction]

n^2 is divisibile by 3
we can write this as 3 | n^2 -> n^2 = 3 . q for some integer q

by quotient reminder theorem, n = d q + r where 0 <= r < d
since n is not divisible by 3, which means 0 is exluded from the reminder

so its 3k + 1 and 3k + 2 since 0 <= r < d where d is 3
case 1: 3k + 1
n^2 = (3k+1)^2
= (3k + 1) (3k + 1)
= 9k^2 + 6k + 1
= 3 (3k^2 + 2k) + 1
this means its divisible by 3 where reminder is less than 3 which contradicts the supposition

case 2: 3k + 2
n^2 = (3k+2)^2
= (3k+2) (3k+2)
= 9k^2 + 12k + 4
= 3 (3k^2 + 4k + 1) + 1
case 2 is also divisible by 3
threfore we found the contradiction since our original supposition we assumed n is not divisibel by 3 but herei t's divisible
since both statement cannot be true this is a contradiction. [therefore the original statment is proven]

c. prove that sqrt(3) is irrational
suppose not. that is , suppose sqrt(3) is rational

sqrt(3) = a/b where a and b is integer and b is nonzero by the definition of reational number
and a/b has 1 as the common factor (simplest form)

square all side
3 = a^2 / b^2
3b^2 = a^2
a^2 = 3b^2

therefore a is a multiple of 3 (has 3 as a common factor) therefore a is divisible by 3

a = 3k
a^2 = 3b^2
3k^2 = 3b^2
9k = 3b^2
3k = b^2

which means b^2 is a multiple of 3 (has 3 as a common factor) therefore  b is divisibile by 3 or 3 | b

since we assumed at the begining that a and b has 1 as a common factor we arrive at a contradiction
because we have proven that a and b has 3 as a factor [therefore the supposition is false and the original statement is true]

20. give an example to show that if d is not prime and n^2 is divisible by d,
then n need not be divisible by d

d is not prime

n^2 is divisible by d = d | n^2 -> n^2 = d . q for some integer q

n does not divide d but n divides n^2

example: 
let d = 4 -> not prime
n^2 = 4 -> n = 2


d | n^2? -> 4 | 4 = true
d does not divide n? 4 does not divide 2 true

if part = true
then part = false
thefore the original statmeent is invalid

21. The quotient-remainder theorem says not only that there exist quotients and remainders but also 
that the quotient and remainder of a division are unique.

Prove the uniqueness.
That is, prove that if a and d are integers with d > 0 and if q1, r1, q2, and r2 are integers such that

a = dq1 + r1 where 0 <= r1 < d

and 

a = dq2 + r2 where 0 <= r2 < d

then

q1 = q2 and r1 = r2



dq1 + r1 = dq2 + r2
r1 - r2 = dq2 - dq1
r1 - r2 = d (q2 - q1)
therefore r1 - r2 is a multiple of d

largest possible value: d-1
smallest value: 0

-d < r1 - r2 < d
-d < 0 < d
therfore r1 - r2 = 0
therefore q2 and q1 must be equal value

22. Prove that sqrt5 is irrational
proof be contradiction
suppose not, that is suppose sqrt5 is rational [we must deduce a contradiction]

sqrt5 = a/b for some integer a and b where b is nonzero and a/b has 1 has the common factor
square both sides
5 = a^2/b^2
a^2 = 5 b^2

therefore a is a multiple of 5, we can write a = 5k

5k^2 = 5b^2
25k = 5b^2
25k/5 = b^2
5k = b^2

therefore b is also a multiple of 5
since in the begning we assumed that a and bas has 1 as common factor, this contradicts our supposition
therefore the original statement is true [qed]

23. prove that for any integer a, 9 does not divide (a^2 - 3)
proof by contradiction
negation: for some ineger a, 9 | a^2 - 3
suppose not. that is, suppose there exists an integer a such that 9 | a^2 - 3
[we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisilibty, d | n can be written as n = d q for some integer q

9 | a^2 - 3
we can rewrite this as

a^2-3 = 9q for some integer q
a^2 = 9q + 3
sqrt both sides
a^2 = 3 (3q + 1)
this means a is divisible by 3 (or 3 | a)

a = 3k
3k^2 = 9q + 3
9k^2 = 3 (3q + 1)
3k^2 = 3q + 1
left side: k is divisible by 3 and leaves no reminder (0)
right side: leaves 1 as a reminder therefore a^2 - 3 is not perfectly divisible
since integer cannot have 2 different reminder we have arrived at a contradiction. threfore the original statement is true

24.An alternative proof of the irrationality of sqrt(2)
counts the number of 2’s on the two sides of the 
equation 2n^2 = m^2 and uses the unique factoriza
tion of integers theorem to deduce a contradiction. 
Write a proof that uses this approach.

Proof sqrt(2) is irrational using 2n^2 = m^2

2n^2 = m^2
= ??

26.  Prove that sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is irrational.
Proof by contradiction.

Suppose not, that is suppose sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is rational
[we must deduce a contradiction]

sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) = q where q is rational
square both side
2 = (q - sqrt 3)^2
2 = q^2 - 2sqrt(3) + 3
2 - q^2+3 = -2q sqrt(3)

since q is rational we have found a contradiction

28. Let N = 2.3.5.7 + 1. What remainder is obtained 
when N is divided by 2? 3? 5? 7? Justify your answer.

n = 211
211 mod 2 = 1
211 mod 3 = 1
211 mod 5 = 1
211 mod 7 = 1

because n has 2,3,5,7 as a factor were essentially dividing those perfectly without a reminder
but the +1 at the end ensures it will always have 1 as the reminder


29.  Suppose a is an integer and p is a prime number 
such that p | a and p | (a+3). What can you deduce 
about p? Why?

a = integer
p = prime

p | a
p | a + 3

a = p q for some intger q
a + 3 = p k

pq + 3 = pk
pq+3−pq=pk−pq
3 = pk - pq
3 = p (k - q)
which means 3 is a multiple of p (p | 3)
therefore p = 3

30. let p1, p2, p3, ... be a list of all prime numbers in ascending order
here is a table of the first six

p1 = 2
p2 = 3
p3 = 5
p4 = 7
p5 = 11
p6 = 13

a.
let n = p1,
let n2 = p1 . p2
let n3 = p1 . p2 . p3
...
n6 = p1 . p2 . p3 . p4 . p5 . p6

calculate n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6
n1 = 2
n2 = 2 . 3 = 6
n3 = 2 . 3 . 5 = 30
n4 = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 = 210
n5 = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 . 11 = 2310
n6 = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 . 11 . 13 = 30030

b. for each i = 1,2,3,4,5,6
find wheter ni is itself prime or just has a prime factor less than itself
(hint use the test primality from exercise 31 in section 4.7 to determine your answer)

exercise 31 section 4.7
if n is not prime then there exists a prime number p such that p <= sqrt(n) and n is divisible by p

n1 = 2 = prime
n2 = 2 . 3 = 6 = not prime but has a prime factor less than itself
n3 = 2 . 3 . 5 = 30 = not prime but has a prime factor less than itself
n4 = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 = 210 = not prime but has a prime factor less than itself
n5 = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 . 11 = 2310 = not prime but has a prime factor less than itself
n6 = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 . 11 . 13 = 30030 = not prime but has a prime factor less than itself

therfore for i > 1, n  is not prime but has a prime factor less than itself.
