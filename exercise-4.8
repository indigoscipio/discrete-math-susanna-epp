The ancient greeks discovered that in a right triangle where both legs have length 1,
the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse
to the length of one of the legs is not equal to a ration of ___
answer: two integers

2. one way to prove that sqrt(2) is an irrational number is to
assume that sqrt(2) = m/n for some integers m and n that have no common
factor greater than 1, use the lemma that says that if the square of an integer
is even then ___, and eventually show that m and n __
answer: the integer is even, it has 2 as a common factor

3. one way to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers is to assume that there is a largest prime number p,
construct the number ___, and then show that this number has to be divisible by a prime number that is greater than __
answer: p1,p2,p3,p...p , p


Exercise set 4.8
1. a calculator display shows that sqrt(2) = 1.414213562
because 1.414213562 = 1.414213562 /  1000000000
this suggests that sqrt(2) is a rational number which contradicts theorem 4.8.1
explain the discrepency

answer: i think this is because the way calculator works it calculates to a certain digit? eg approximation?
it cannot represent infinite number so its limited


2. Example 4.3.1(h) illustrates a technique for show
ing that any repeating decimal number is rational. 
A calculator display shows the result of a certain 
calculation as 40.72727272727. Can you be sure 
that the result of the calculation is a rational num
ber? Explain.

Following the steps of example 4.3.1h
let x = 0.72727272
100x = 72.72727272

100x - x = 72.727272-0.727272 = 72
but also 100x-x = 99x
hence 99x = 72
x = 72/99

threfore it can be expressed as a rational number because its a ratio of two integers and the denominator does not equal 0

3. could there be a rational number whose first trillion digits are the same as the first trillion digits of sqrt(2)?
answer: yes, it is possible because we can find ways to represent trillion digits as rational number until the trillionth digits,
but after that the digits would diverge (because ratioanl number will never be infinite and vice versa)

4. a calculator display shows that the result of a certain calculation is 0.2
can you be sure the result of the calculation is a rational number?
answer: yes because we can represent 0.2 as 2/10, 0.2 does not have inf

5.  Let S be the statement:

The cube root of every irrational number is irrational.
This statement is true, but the following “proof” is incorrect.
Explain the mistake.

 “Proof (by contradiction):
 Suppose not.  Suppose the cube root of every irrational number is rational
 But 2sqrt(2) is irrational because it is a product of a rational and an irrational number, 
 and the cube root of 2sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), which is irrational.
 
 This is a contradiction, and hence it is not true that the cube root of every irrational number is rational.
 Thus the statement to be proved is true.”

 answer:
 negation: Ex number i, i is irrational, cube root of i is rational 
 correct negation: There The cube root of some irrational number is rational


 determine which statements in 6 - 16 are true and which are false.
 Prove those that are true and disprove those that are false.

6. 6 - 7sqrt(2) is irrational
answer: true because integer - irrational is irrational
proof by contradiction: suppose 6 - 7sqrt(2) is rational, call it q
so 6 - 7sqrt(2)= q
sqrt(2) = q-6/7
q-6 is rational and q-6/7 is also rational because 7 does not equal 0
which means sqrt2 must be a rational number
contradiction is found and therefore the original statement is true

7. 3sqrt(2) - 7 is irrational
true because irrational - integer is irrational

proof by contradiction:
suppose 3sqrt(2)-7 is rational, call it r
so 3sqrt(2)-7 = r

now we solve for sqrt(2)
sqrt(2) = r+7/3
we know that r is rational and r+7 is also rational since rational + rational = rational
3 is also nonzero threfore sqrt(2) has the form of rational number
but this is a contradiction because sqrt(2) is rational therefore original statmenet is true
 

8.sqrt(4) is irrational
false because sqrt 4 is 2 which is integer
you can solve sqrt(4) = 2 where 2 is an integer (this is the counterexample)

9. sqrt(2)/6 is irrational
true because irrational / integer = irrational
proof by contradiction: sqrt(2)/6 is rational
[we must deduce contradiction]

sqrt(2)/6 = q
sqrt(2) = 6q
therefore 6q is rational since 6 . rational = rational
but sqrt(2) is irrational and therefore this i sthe contradiction


10. the sum of any two irrational numbers is irrational
answer: the statement is false 
coutnerexample: sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2)
their sum is 0

11. the difference of any two irrational numbers is irrational
answer: the statement is false
counterexample: sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) = 0
their difference is 0

12. the positive square root of a positive irrational number is irrational
answer:

positive irrational number n where n > 0
sqrt(2) = irrational
sqrt(pi) = irrational

generalized proof
proof by contradiction
Suppose not. that is, suppose There exists a positive irrational number n such that  n  is not rational.

[We must deduce a contradiction.]
sqrt(n) = q where q is rational
square both sides
n = q^2
we know that q^2 is rational since rational^2 is rational therefore n is rational
but this is a contradiction because we supposed positive square root to be irrational
therefore we found a contradiction and the original statement is true


13. if r is any rational nubmer and s is any irrational number, then r/s is irrational
answer: let r = 0/1 (0) and s = sqrt(2)
r/s = 0/sqrt(2) = 0 (rational)
therefore the counterexample is found

14. the sum of any two positive irrational number is irratinal
answer: 

let i = positive irrational, q = irrational
i + q = positive  irrational number s

1 + sqrt(2) + 2 - sqrt(2) = 3 + 0 = 3
therefore a counterexamle is found

15. the product of two irrational numbers is irrational
counterexample:
let i and r both irrational number
i = sqrt(2)
r = sqrt(2)
sqrt(2) . sqrt(2) = 2 which is an integer
therefore the original statement is false and the counterexample is found

16. if an integer greater than 1 is a perfect square, then its cube root is irrational
Ax integer n where n > 1, if n is a perfect square, cuberoot(n) is irrational
let s = perfect square where s > 1
let c = cuberoot(s)

s = 4 -> cuberoot(4) = irrational
seems to be true, move to generalized proof

prof by contradiction
negation: Ex itneger n where n > 1, n is a perfect square and cuberoot(n) is rational
Suppose Not, that is ,supppose there exists a integer n where n > 1, n is a perfect square and cuberoot(n) is rational

cuberoot(n) = q where q is rational
cube all side
n = q^3 therefore q is rational number because q.q.q is rational

k^2 = a^3/b^3
k^2b^3 = a^3

17.  Consider the following sentence:
If x is rational then sqrt(x) is irrational.
Is this sentence always true, sometimes true and sometimes false, or always false? Justify your answer.


let x = 4/1 (4)
sqrt(4) = 2 which is rational (2/1)
therefore the stentence above is false since we found a counterexample
so its sometimes true and false depending on the input.

18. a. prove that for every integer a, if a^3 is even then a is even
answer: 
let a = 2
2^3 = 8 -> even
let a = 4
4^3 = 64 -> even

the pattern seems to be true, now for general proof
proof by contradiction
negation: for some integer a, a^3 is even and a is odd
Suppose not. That is, sppose there exists some integer a such that a^3 is even and a is odd [we must deduce a contradiction]

let a = 2k + 1

a^3 = (2k+1)^3
= (2k+1) (2k+1) (2k+1)
= (4k^2 + 4k + 1) (2k + 1)
= (8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1)
= 2 (4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1

there fore a^3 is odd since it has the form 2 . some integer but this is a contradiction since we assumed a^3 is even at the begining
therefore the contradiction is proven and te original statmenet is true



b. prove that cuberoot(2) is irrational
