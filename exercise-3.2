Exercise set 3.2
1. Which of the following is a negation for “All 
discrete mathematics students are athletic”? More 
than one answer may be correct.

For all student x, if x is discrete math student, then x is athletic
P = x is discrete math student
Q = x is athletic
Ax, P(x) -> Q(x)
negation is Ex, P(x) A ~Q(x) OR ~(Ax, P(x) -> Q(x))

a. There is a discrete mathematics student who is nonathletic.
E student x, x is discrete math sudent A x is not athletic
Ex, P(x) A ~Q(x)
answer: yes, this is a correct negation

b. All discrete mathematics students are nonathletic.
Ax, P(x) -> ~Q(x)
answer: this is not a correct negation

c. There is an athletic person who is not a discrete mathematics student.
Ex, x is athletic AND not a discrete math student
Ex, Q(x) AND ~P(x)
answer: this is not a correct negation

d. No discrete mathematics students are athletic.
Ax, x is discrete math student, x is not athletic”
Ax, P(x) -> ~Q(x)
answer: this is not a correct negation

e. Some discrete mathematics students are nonathletic.
Ex, x is discrete math student AND x is not athletic
Ex, P(x) AND ~Q(x)
answer: yes, this is the correct negation

f.  No athletic people are discrete mathematics students.
Ax, x is athletic -> x is not discrete math student
Ax, Q(x) -> ~P(x)
answer: this is not a correct negation

Ex, P(x) -> Q(x)
answer: this is not a correct negation

Ex, ~Q(x) AND ~P(x)
answer: this is not a correct negation (its a contrapositive)

 f. There is a dog that is disloyal.
Ex, x is a dog AND x is disloyal
Ex, P(x) AND ~Q(x)
answer: yes, this is the correct negation
