let x -1
-1^2 = 1
 1 < 1 (false)
 the contrapositive statement is false
 counterexample above

convrese: All real number x, if x > 0 then x^2 >= 1
let x = 1
1 > 1 (true)
1^2 >= 1 (true)

let x = 100
100 > 0 (true)
100^2 >= 1 (true)
the converse is true

inverse: All real number x, if x^2 < 1 then x <= 0
let x = 0
0^2 < 1 (true)
0 <= 0 (true)

let x = -1
-1^2 < 1 (false)
-1 <= 0
the inverse is false. counterexample above


27. exercise 17
A integer d, if 6/d is an integer -> D = 3
contrapositive: A integer d, if d does not equal to 3 -> 6/d is not an integer
let d = 2
6/2 = 3 (false)

let d = -1
6/-1 = -6 (false)
the contrapositive is false (counterexample above)

converse: A integer d, if d = 3 -> 6/d is an integer
let d = 3
6/3 = 3
the converse is true


inverse: A integer d, if 6/d is not an integer -> d does not equal to 3
let d = 5
6/5 (true) = does not equal to 3 (true)

let d = -1
-6/5 (true) = does not equal to 3
The inverse is true

28. exercise 18
Ax E R, if x (x+1) > 0 then x > 0 or x < -1
contrapositive: Ax E R, if ~(x > 0 or x < -1) then ~(x(x+1) > 0)
contrapositive: Ax E R, if x <= 0 AND x >= -1 then x(x+1) <= 0
let x = 0
0 <= 0 AND 0 >= -1 (true)
0(0 + 1) < = 0 (true)
0 <= 0 (true)

let x = -1
-1 <= 0 AND -1 >= -1 (true)
-1(-1+1) <= 0 (true)
therefore the contrapositive is true

convrse: Ax E R, if x > 0 or x < -1 then x(x+1) > 0
x is a number from 1 - ...
or -2 to -... excluding 0 and -1
1(1+1) > 0 = 2 > 0 = true
-2(-2+1) > 0 = 2 > 0 = true
therefore the converse is true

inverse: Ax E R, if x(x+1) <= 0 then x <= 0 AND x >= -1
based on hyphothesis x should be all neg number including 0

let x = 0
0 <= 0 (true) AND 0 >= -1 (true) = true

let x = -1
-1 <= 0 (true) AND -1 >= -1 (true)


let x = -100
-100 <= 0 (true) AND -100 >= -1 (false)

let n = 4 - is not a prime (true)
let n = 0 - is not a prime (true)
yes, the contrapositiev is true

converse: Ax E Z, if n is odd or n = 2 then n is prime
let n = 2 -> n is NOT a prime (false)
the converse is false (coutnerexample above)

inverse: Ax E Z, if n is not a prime then n is even AND n does not equal to 2
let n = 15 (not a prime)
n is even - false
n does not equal to 2 - true
the inverse is false (counterexample abvove)

if a - c is odd
0 - 3 = -3 ( odd), true
 (a - b is odd OR b - c is odd)
 (0 - 2) OR (2 - 3) is odd
 false or true
 true

 let a = -2
 b = -2
 c = -3
-2 + 3 (true)
 (-2 + 2) OR (-2 + 3) is odd
 false or true
 true

 im going to just assume the contrapositive is true. I don't want to waste time finding the counterexample


converse: A integers a,b,and c, if a - c is even then a - b is even AND b - c is even
let a = 0
let b = 1
let c = 2
a - c is even (0-2) = true
a - b is even AND b - c is even = 0-1 AND 1-2 = false
based on the counterexample  Therfore the converse is false.


inverse: A integers a,b,and c, if a - b is odd OR b-c is odd, then then a - c is odd
let a = 0
let b = 1
let c = 2

a - b is odd OR b - c is odd (0 - 2) OR (1 - 2) = true
a - c is odd = 0 - 2 = false
based on the counterexample therefore the inverse is false.

let n = 7
n is odd OR n is not divisible by 3
n is not divisible by 6 = true

let n = 12
n is odd OR n is not divisible by 3
n is not divisible by 6 = true

there is no counterexample therefore this is true


converse: A integer n, if  n is dibisible by 2 and n is dibisible by 3, then n is divisible by 6, 
no counterexample can be found - this is true


inverse: A integer n, if n is not divisible by 6, then n is not divisible by 2 OR n is not divisible by 3
no counterxample can be found, statement is true

For all function f, if f is polynomial, then f has a real root
not sufficient = ~(p ->q) = p A ~q
answer: There is at least one function f that is a polynomial AND does not have a real root

49. The computer scientists Richard Conway and David Gries once wrote:
The absence of error messages during translation of a computer program is
only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for reasonable [program] correctness.
p = the absenceo f error messages during translation of a computer program
q = reasonable program correctness
not sufficient = ~(p ->q) = p A ~q
necessary = q -> p
necessary and not sufficient = q -> p AND p A ~q
answer: If a program is correct, then it has no error messages during translation. AND if a program has no error, it does not mean it is correct.

A frequent-flyer club brochure states, “You may 
select among carriers only if they offer the same 
lowest fare.” Assuming that “only if” has its for
mal, logical meaning, does this statement guaran
tee that if two carriers offer the same lowest fare, 
the customer will be free to choose between them? 
Explain.



p = you may select among carriers
q = they offre the same lowest fare
p only if q = ~q -> ~p = p -> q
if you can select among carriers, then they are offering the same lowest fare.

does it mean statement guarantee if two carriers offer the same lowest fare,
then the ucstomer wil be free to choose between them?
the question is in q -> p statement (converse)
answer: no, it only guarantees that if you can select among carriers, then they are offering the lowest fare.
