3. indicate wheter the staements in parts a -d are true/false for all functions
justify your answer

a. If two elements in the domain of a function are 
equal, then their images in the co-domain are 
equal.
answer: true because x1 = x2 then f(x1 = f(x2))
a function must map one input -> one output
if both inputs are exactly the same , then the result  must be identical

 b. If two elements in the co-domain of a function 
are equal, then their preimages in the domain 
are also equal.
answer:
f(x1) does not equal to f(x2)
false because you can have many inputs that produce the same ouptut

 c. A function can have the same output for more 
than one input.
answer: true because many inputs can result in same output
a well defined function only requires one input that maps exactly one ouput
it doesn't restrict two different inputs resulting to the same output

 d. A function can have the same input for more 
than one output.
answer: function can only map 1 input -> 1 output so the output needs to be unique

g(x) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5

is f=g? explain
answer
for a functio nto be equal for every input it must produce equal output

lets check one by one

f(0) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 4^2 mod 5 = 16 mod 5 = 1

f(1) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 5^2 mod 5 = 25 mod 5 = 0

f(2) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 6^2 mod 5 = 36 mod 5 = 1

f(3) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 7^2 mod 5 = 4

f(4) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 8^2 mod 5 = 4

now lets check g
g(0) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (0^2+3(0))+1) mod 5
= 0 + 0 + 1 mod 5
= 1 mod 5 = 1

g(1) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (1^2+3(1))+1) mod 5
= 1 + 3 + 1 mod 5
= 5 mod 5 = 0

g(2) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (2^2+3(2))+1) mod 5
= 4 + 6 + 1 mod 5
= 11 mod 5 = 1

g(3) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (3^2+3(3))+1) mod 5
= 9 + 9 + 1 mod 5
= 19 mod 5 = 4

g(4) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (4^2+3(4))+1) mod 5
= 16 + 12 + 1 mod 5
= 29 mod 5 = 4

since the every input equals the same putout therefore f = g


14. define function h and k from R to R by the following forumlas
for every x E R
H(x) = floor(x) + 1
K(x) = ceil(1)

does H = K? explain

answer:
lets pick arbitrary small number

H(1) = floor(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
K(1) = ceil(1) = 1

therefore not equal

15. let f and g be functions from the set of all real number to itself
define the product functions

f.g : R -> R and 
g.f : R -> R as follows

for every x E R,

(f.g)(x) = f(x) . g(x)
(g.f)(x) = g(x) . f(x)

does f . g = g . f? explain

lets pick arbitrary number
f = 1
g = 2

(f.g)(x) = 1 . 2 = 2
(g.f)(x) = 2 . 1 = 2

i'm guessing this is equal by commutative law?

16. let f and g be the functions from the set of all real numbers to itself
define the new functions

f - g: R -> R and
g - f: R -> R as follows
for every x E R

(f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
(g-f)(x) = g(x) - f(x)

does f - g = g -f ? explain

answer
it does not equal because commutative law does not work for negative
counterexample:

let f = -1
g = 1

(f-g)(x) = -1 - 1 = -2
(g-f)(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2

19. use the definition of logarithm to proev that for any positive real number b
with b does not equal 1, log base b of b = 1

by the definition of logarithm,
b raised to the power of what is b? the answer is always 1 because it doesnt change
the base value

20. use the definition of logarithm to prove that for any positive real number b
with b does not equal 1, log base b of 1 = 0

by the definiton of logarithm
log base b of x = y is equivalent to b^y = x
if we substituve b for x and 0 for y,    the statement hods true

b^0 = 1 for any positive real base does not equal 1

21. if b is any positive real number with b does not equal 1 and x
is any real number, b^-x is defined as follows

b^-x = 1/b^x. use this definition and the definition of logarithm to prove

that log b (1/u) = -log b(u)
for all positive real numbers u and b, with b does not euqla to 1

answer:
from the definiton of logarithm we know that
log base b of x = y is equivalent to b^y = x

let y = -log b (u) -> the RHS
isolate the log and multiple both sides by -1
log b (u) = -y
convert to exponential form
b^-y = u

1/b^y = u
take reciprocal
b^y = 1/u
by the definition of logarithm log base b of 1/u = y = -log b (u)

22. use the unique factorialization for integers theorem (section 4.4)
and the definition of logarithm to prove that log 3 of 7 is irratioanl

we need to show log 3 (7) = irrational
proof by contradiction
assume log 3 of 7 is rational
log 3 of 7 = a/b where a and b are integers and b does not equal 0
and gcd of a/b = 1

applying the definition of logarithm

3^a/b = 7
raise both to the power of b
= (3^a/b)^b = 7^b
= 3^a = 7^b 
For the two numbers to be equal, they must have the same prime factorization.
The only way a number can have both 3 and 7 as its only prime factors is if it's the number 1.

which contradicts the proof


23. if b and y are positive real numbers such that log b (y) = 3, what is log 1/b (y)?
explain

we know b^3 = y

let x = log 1/b (y)
log 1/b (y) = x
so (1/b)^x = y

by the definition of negative exponent 

b^-n = 1/b^n

(b^-1)^x = y
b^-x = y

we know b^3 = y
b^-x = b^3
x = -3

24. if b and y are positive real numbers such that log b (y) = 2
what is log b^2 (y)? explain

we know log b (y) = 2
b^2 = y

let x = log b^2 (y)
log b^2 (y) = x 

= (b^2)^x = y
= b^2x = b^2
x = 1

25. let a = {2,3,5}

33. student A tries to define a function g: Q -> Z by the rule
g(m/n) = m - n for all integers m and n with n does not equal 0

student b claims that g is not well defined
justify student B's claim

a funciton is well deifned if input corresponds to output
so its unique

lets see and pick an example

let m = 1
let n = 2
g(1/2) = 1-2 = -1 -> an integer

let m = 2
let n = 4
g(2/4) = 2-4 = -2 -> an integer but different output

since a single input value results in two diferent outputs
the function g is not well defined. therefore it violates the requirement
that every input must have a unique output.


34. student C tries to define a function
h : Q -> Q by the rule


h(m-n) = m^2 / n for all integers m and n with n does not euqla 0
student d claims that h is not well deined. justify student d's claim

answer:
a well defined function for every input it produces one unique output

lets pick an example

let m = 1
let n = 2

h(m/n) = m^2/n
= 1/2

let m = 2
let n = 4
h(m/n) = m^2/n
4/4 = 1

since the same number (1/2 and 2/4) produces idferent output,
we can conclude the function h is not well defined.

35. let u = {1,2,3,4}.
student A tries to define a function R: U -> Z as folows
for each x E U,

r(x) is the integer y so that (xy) mod 5 = 1

student b claims that r is not well defined
who is correct student a or student b? justify your anserw

answer:
lets test it one by one for each input

R(1) = xy mod 5 = 1
1.y mod 5 = 1
here we can use y = 1 which gives the same result
y = 1

r(2) = xy mod 5 = 1
2.y mod 5 = 1
y = 3

r(3) = xy mod 5 = 1
3.y mod 5 = 1
y = 2

r(4) = xy mod 5 = 1
4.y mod 5 = 1
y = 4

sinc every input produces unique output therefore its well define

36. let v = {1,2,3}
student c tries to define a function: s: v-> v as follows
for each x E V

s(x) is the integer y in v so that (xy) mod 4 = 1
student D claims that S is not well defined
who is correct student C or student D? justify your anserw

answer:
a well defined function means for every input it produces one unique output

lets try it
s(1) = (xy) mod 4 = 1
= (1*y) mod 4 = 1
y = 1

s(2) = (xy) mod 4 = 1
= (2*y) mod 4 = 1
y = ??
since theris no integer y that satisfies this, the output for s(2) does not exist

s(3) = (xy) mod 4 = 1
= (3*y) mod 4 = 1
y = 3

therefore the function s is not well defined

37. On certain computers the integer data type goes 
from -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647. Let 
S be the set of all integers from 22,147,483,648 
through 2,147,483,647. Try to define a function  
f  : S -> S by the rule f (n) 5= n^2 for each n in S. Is f 
well defined? Explain.

answer: a well defined function means every input results in one unique output

lets pick a counterexample
f(50000) -> 2500000000 result way too large and not in the domain

38. let x = {a,b,c}
let y = {r,s,t,u,v,w}

define f: x -> y as follows: f(a) = v, f(b) = v, and f(c) = t

a. draw an arrow diagram for f
answer:
a -> v
b -> v
c -> t

b. let a = {a.b}, c = {t}, d = {u,v}, e = {r,s}
find f(a), f(x), f^-1(c), f^-1(d), f^-1(e), and f^-1(y)

answer:
f(a) = {v}
f(x) = {v,v,t}
f^-1(c) = {c}
f^-1(d) = {a,b}
f^-1(e) = {the empty set}
f^-1(Y) = {a,b,c}

39. let x = {1,2,3,4}
Y={a,b,c,d,e}
define g: x -> y as follows:
g(1) = a, g(2) = a, g(3) = a, g(4) = d

a. draw an arrow diagram for g

b. let A = {2,3}, C = {a}, D = {b,c}
find g(A), g(x), g^-1(C), g^-1(D), and g^-1(Y)

answer:
a.
1 -> a
2 -> a
3 -> a
4 -> d

b. 
g(A) = {a}
g(X) = {a,d}
g^-1(C) = {1,2,3}
g^-1(D) = {the empty set}
g^-1(Y) = {1,2,3,4}

40. let X and Y be sets
let A and B be any subsets of X
let f be function from x -> y
fill in the blanks in the following porof that

F(A) U F(B) is a subset of F(A U B)

proof: let y be any leemnt in f(a).bydefinition of union, (i)

case 1: y E F(A) in this case by definition of f(a), y = f(x) for (ii) x E A.
since a is a subset of A U B, it follows that from the definition of union that x E (iii)
hence y = f(x) for some x A U B and thus by definition of f(A U B), y E (iv)

case 2: y E F(b): in this case, by definition of (b), (v) for some x E B. since b is a subset of a U B
it follows from the definition of uniont that (vi). thus y E F(A U B).

therefore regardless of wheter y E F(A) or y E F(B we have that y E F(A U B)
[as was to be shown]

answer:
i) y is in f(A) or y is in f(B)
ii) some
iii) A U B
iv) f (A U B)
v) x = f(b)
vi) x E A U B

In 41–49 let X and Y be sets, let A and B be any subsets of 
X, and let C and D be any subsets of Y. Determine which 
of the properties are true for every function F from X to Y 
and which are false for at least one function F from X to Y. 
Justify your answers.

41. if A is a subset of B then f(A) is a subset of f(B)
answer: 

let y be an arbitrary element of a

by the definition of image
thereexiss some lement x in set A such that F(x) = y
we know that A is a subset of B
this means x is in a and x is in b
