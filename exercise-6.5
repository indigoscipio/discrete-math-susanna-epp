3. indicate wheter the staements in parts a -d are true/false for all functions
justify your answer

a. If two elements in the domain of a function are 
equal, then their images in the co-domain are 
equal.
answer: true because x1 = x2 then f(x1 = f(x2))
a function must map one input -> one output
if both inputs are exactly the same , then the result  must be identical

 b. If two elements in the co-domain of a function 
are equal, then their preimages in the domain 
are also equal.
answer:
f(x1) does not equal to f(x2)
false because you can have many inputs that produce the same ouptut

 c. A function can have the same output for more 
than one input.
answer: true because many inputs can result in same output
a well defined function only requires one input that maps exactly one ouput
it doesn't restrict two different inputs resulting to the same output

 d. A function can have the same input for more 
than one output.
answer: function can only map 1 input -> 1 output so the output needs to be unique

f(x) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
g(x) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5

is f=g? explain
answer
for a functio nto be equal for every input it must produce equal output

lets check one by one

f(0) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 4^2 mod 5 = 16 mod 5 = 1

f(1) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 5^2 mod 5 = 25 mod 5 = 0

f(2) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 6^2 mod 5 = 36 mod 5 = 1

f(3) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 7^2 mod 5 = 4

f(4) = (x+4)^2 mod 5
= 8^2 mod 5 = 4

now lets check g
g(0) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (0^2+3(0))+1) mod 5
= 0 + 0 + 1 mod 5
= 1 mod 5 = 1

g(1) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (1^2+3(1))+1) mod 5
= 1 + 3 + 1 mod 5
= 5 mod 5 = 0

g(2) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (2^2+3(2))+1) mod 5
= 4 + 6 + 1 mod 5
= 11 mod 5 = 1

g(3) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (3^2+3(3))+1) mod 5
= 9 + 9 + 1 mod 5
= 19 mod 5 = 4

g(4) = (x^2+3x+1) mod 5
= (4^2+3(4))+1) mod 5
= 16 + 12 + 1 mod 5
= 29 mod 5 = 4

since the every input equals the same putout therefore f = g


14. define function h and k from R to R by the following forumlas
for every x E R
H(x) = floor(x) + 1
K(x) = ceil(1)

does H = K? explain

answer:
lets pick arbitrary small number

H(1) = floor(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
K(1) = ceil(1) = 1

therefore not equal

15. let f and g be functions from the set of all real number to itself
define the product functions

f.g : R -> R and 
g.f : R -> R as follows

for every x E R,

(f.g)(x) = f(x) . g(x)
(g.f)(x) = g(x) . f(x)

does f . g = g . f? explain

lets pick arbitrary number
f = 1
g = 2

(f.g)(x) = 1 . 2 = 2
(g.f)(x) = 2 . 1 = 2

i'm guessing this is equal by commutative law?

16. let f and g be the functions from the set of all real numbers to itself
define the new functions

f - g: R -> R and
g - f: R -> R as follows
for every x E R

(f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
(g-f)(x) = g(x) - f(x)

does f - g = g -f ? explain

answer
it does not equal because commutative law does not work for negative
counterexample:

let f = -1
g = 1

(f-g)(x) = -1 - 1 = -2
(g-f)(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2

19. use the definition of logarithm to proev that for any positive real number b
with b does not equal 1, log base b of b = 1

by the definition of logarithm,
b raised to the power of what is b? the answer is always 1 because it doesnt change
the base value

20. use the definition of logarithm to prove that for any positive real number b
with b does not equal 1, log base b of 1 = 0

by the definiton of logarithm
log base b of x = y is equivalent to b^y = x
if we substituve b for x and 0 for y,    the statement hods true

b^0 = 1 for any positive real base does not equal 1

21. if b is any positive real number with b does not equal 1 and x
is any real number, b^-x is defined as follows

b^-x = 1/b^x. use this definition and the definition of logarithm to prove

that log b (1/u) = -log b(u)
for all positive real numbers u and b, with b does not euqla to 1

answer:
from the definiton of logarithm we know that
log base b of x = y is equivalent to b^y = x

let y = -log b (u) -> the RHS
isolate the log and multiple both sides by -1
log b (u) = -y
convert to exponential form
b^-y = u

1/b^y = u
take reciprocal
b^y = 1/u
by the definition of logarithm log base b of 1/u = y = -log b (u)

22. use the unique factorialization for integers theorem (section 4.4)
and the definition of logarithm to prove that log 3 of 7 is irratioanl

we need to show log 3 (7) = irrational
proof by contradiction
assume log 3 of 7 is rational
log 3 of 7 = a/b where a and b are integers and b does not equal 0
and gcd of a/b = 1

applying the definition of logarithm

3^a/b = 7
raise both to the power of b
= (3^a/b)^b = 7^b
= 3^a = 7^b 
For the two numbers to be equal, they must have the same prime factorization.
The only way a number can have both 3 and 7 as its only prime factors is if it's the number 1.

which contradicts the proof


23. if b and y are positive real numbers such that log b (y) = 3, what is log 1/b (y)?
explain

we know b^3 = y

let x = log 1/b (y)
log 1/b (y) = x
so (1/b)^x = y

by the definition of negative exponent 

b^-n = 1/b^n

(b^-1)^x = y
b^-x = y

we know b^3 = y
b^-x = b^3
x = -3

24. if b and y are positive real numbers such that log b (y) = 2
what is log b^2 (y)? explain

we know log b (y) = 2
b^2 = y

let x = log b^2 (y)
log b^2 (y) = x 

= (b^2)^x = y
= b^2x = b^2
x = 1

25. let a = {2,3,5}
let b = {x,y}

p1(5,x) = 5
range: $$\{(2, x), (2, y), (3, x), (3, y), (5, x), (5, y)\}$$

b. p2(2,y) = y
p2(5,x) = x
