1. given a function f from a set x to set y, f(x) is
answer: the unique output element in Y that is related to x by f

2. give a function f from set x to set y, if f(x) = y,
then y is called ___ or ___ or ___
answer: the output of f, the value of f at x

answer: the set of all y in Y such that f(x) = y
The new list that each x has been processed

4. given a function f from set x to y, if f(x) = y then x is called
answer: inverse image of y under f; preimage of y

x y
1 -> b
3 -> b
5 -> b

g1 = b
g3 = b
g5 = b

yes, 1 is an inverse image of b

e. what is the inverse image of b? c?
inverse image of b = {1,3,5}
inverse image of c = {empty set}

f. represent g as a set of ordered pairs.
g = {(1,b),(3,b),(5,b)}


3. indicate wheter the staements in parts a -d are true/false for all functions
justify your answer

a. If two elements in the domain of a function are 
equal, then their images in the co-domain are 
equal.
answer: true because x1 = x2 then f(x1 = f(x2))
a function must map one input -> one output
if both inputs are exactly the same , then the result  must be identical

 b. If two elements in the co-domain of a function 
are equal, then their preimages in the domain 
are also equal.
answer:
f(x1) does not equal to f(x2)
false because you can have many inputs that produce the same ouptut

 c. A function can have the same output for more 
than one input.
answer: true because many inputs can result in same output
a well defined function only requires one input that maps exactly one ouput
it doesn't restrict two different inputs resulting to the same output

 d. A function can have the same input for more 
than one output.
answer: function can only map 1 input -> 1 output so the output needs to be unique


4.
a. find all functions from x = {a,b} to Y = {u,v}
