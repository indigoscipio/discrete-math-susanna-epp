1. given a function f from a set x to set y, f(x) is
answer: the unique output element in Y that is related to x by f

2. give a function f from set x to set y, if f(x) = y,
then y is called ___ or ___ or ___
answer: the output of f, the value of f at x

3. given a function f from set x to y, the range of f (or image of x under f is)
answer: the set of all y in Y such that f(x) = y
The new list that each x has been processed

4. given a function f from set x to y, if f(x) = y then x is called
answer: inverse image of y under f; preimage of y

5. given a function f from a set x to set y, if y E y,
 then f^-1(y) = x and is called
 answer; the inverse image of y

6. given functions f and g from a set x to set y,
f = g if and only if
answer: f produces the same output as g for each item in the set
f(x) = g(x)


7. given a positive real numberx x and b with b does not equal 1,
log b of x = ??
answer: b^? = x or the exponent of b that result in x

8. given a function f from a set x to set y and a subset of A of X, f(a) = ??
answer:  y E Y | y = f(x) for some x E A

9. given a function from a set x to set y and a subset c of y,
f^=1(c) = X

exerise 6.5

1. let x = {1,3,5}
y = {s,t,u,v}
define f: x -> y by the following arrow diagram

x -> y
1 -> v
3 -> s
5 -> v

a. write the domain of f and the codomain of f
domain: X = {1,3,5}
codomain: Y = {s,t,u,v}

b. find f(1), f(3) and f(5)
f1 = v
f3 = s
f5 = v

c. what is the range of f?
range = {s,v}

d. is 3 an inverse image of s?
is 1 an inverse image of u?
yes, 3 is an inverse image of s
no, 1 is not an invrese image of u

e. what is the inverse image of s? u? and v?
inverse image of s: 3
inverse image of u: the empty set/nothing
inverse image of v: {1,5}

f. reprsent f as a set of ordered pairs
= {(1,v),(3,s),(5,v)}
