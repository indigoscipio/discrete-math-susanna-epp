3. indicate wheter the staements in parts a -d are true/false for all functions
justify your answer

a. If two elements in the domain of a function are 
equal, then their images in the co-domain are 
equal.
answer: true because x1 = x2 then f(x1 = f(x2))
a function must map one input -> one output
if both inputs are exactly the same , then the result  must be identical

 b. If two elements in the co-domain of a function 
are equal, then their preimages in the domain 
are also equal.
answer:
f(x1) does not equal to f(x2)
false because you can have many inputs that produce the same ouptut

 c. A function can have the same output for more 
than one input.
answer: true because many inputs can result in same output
a well defined function only requires one input that maps exactly one ouput
it doesn't restrict two different inputs resulting to the same output

 d. A function can have the same input for more 
than one output.
answer: function can only map 1 input -> 1 output so the output needs to be unique
