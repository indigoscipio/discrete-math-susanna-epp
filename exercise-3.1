Exercise set 3.1
1. A menagerie consists of seven brown dogs, two 
black dogs, six gray cats, ten black cats, five blue 
birds, six yellow birds, and one black bird. Deter
mine which of the following statements are true 
and which are false.

M = {7 brown dogs,2 black dogs,6 gray cats,10 black cats,5 blue birds,6 yellow birds,1 black bird}

a. There is an animal in the menagerie that is red.
this statement is false, there is no single red animal {Ex E M, x is red} = false

b. Every animal in the menagerie is a bird or a mammal.
{Ax E M | x is (Bird V Mammal)} = this statement is true

c. every animal in the menagerie is brown or gray or black
{Ax E M | x is (Brown V Gray V Black)} = this statement is false. There is a blue and yellow color in Menagerie

d. There is an animal in the menagerie that is neither a cat nor a dog.
{Ex E M | x is ~(Cat V Dog)} = true there is at least one occurence of bird (which is neither a cat nor a dog)

e. no animal in the menagerie is blue
false because there is a blue bird in Menagerie

f. There are in the menagerie a dog, a cat, and a bird that all have the same color.
this statement is true because there exists a black dog, a black cat, and black bird in which all have the same color

2. Indicate which of the following statements are true 
and which are false. Justify your answers as best 
as you can.
a. every integer is a real number = this is true because integer is a subset of real number (I think?)
example: positive integer is real number and also integer, -integer is also a real number and integer, 0 is also both integer and real number

b. 0 is a positive real number
I think this statment is false because zero is neither negative is positive.

c. for every real number r, -r is a negative real number
This one's true i think, because if we take positive r then the negative is always the same r

d. every real number is an integer
i think this statement is false because no integer can be decimal or fraction

3.  Let R(m, n) be the predicate“If m is a factor of n^2 
then m is a factor of n,” with domain for both m 
and n being Z the set of integers.

R(m,n) = if m is a factor of n^2 -> m is a factor of n
m,n is an element of Z set of integers

a. Explain why R(m, n) is false if m = 25 and n = 10.
R(25,10) = if 25 is a factor of 10^2 -> 25 is a factor of 10
true -> false
this is false because the conclusion of this implication is false, 25 is not a factor of 10

b. Give values different from those in part (a) for 
which R(m, n) is false.
answer: R(25,10), R(50,10), R(100,10)


c. Explain why R(m, n) is true if m = 5 and n = 10.
R(5,10) = if 5 is a factor of 10^2 -> 5 is a factor of 10
true -> true
this is true because the premise and conclusion of this implication is both true, 5 is a factor of 10

d.  Give values different from those in part (c) for 
which R(m, n) is true.
answer: R(2,4), R(2,8), R(2,16)

a. Explain why Q(x, y) is false if x = -2 and y 1.
-2 < 1 -> -2^2 < 1^2 = true -> 4 < 1 (false)
this statement is false because the premise is true but conclusion for this implication is false.

b. Give values different from those in part (a) for which Q(x, y) is false.
answer: Q(-3,2) Q(-4,3)

c. Explain why Q(x, y) is true if x = 3 and y = 8.
3 < 8 -> -3^2 < 8^2 = true -> 9 < 64 (true)
it is true because the premise and conclusion are both true so it satisfied the given implication

d. Give values different from those in part (c) for which Q(x, y) is true
answer: Q(3,8), Q(4,9), Q(5,10)

no {s1s} OR {00s, 11s}

all possible combination: {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}
following the first rule so the final answer is
{000, 001, 010, 011, 101, 110, 111}


b. No string in T has all three characters the same.
{001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110}

is universal but is implicitly quantified. Copy the 
statement as it appears and rewrite it making the 
quantification explicit. Give a complete citation 
for your example, including title, author, publisher, 
year, and page number.

"For all nodes in a binary search tree, every node in the left subtree of a given node has a key that is less than the key of the given node."

32. Let R be the domain of the predicate variable x. 
Which of the following are true and which are 
false? Give counter examples for the statements 

R = domain of the predicate variable x
a. x > 2 -> x > 1
x > 2 = {3,4,5,...}
x > 1 = {2,3,4,...}
this is true because the truth set of x > 2 is included in truth set of x > 1

b. x > 2 -> x^2 > 4
x > 2 = {3,4,5,...}
x^2 > 4 = x > sqrt(4) or x < sqrt(-4) = {...,-7,-6,-5,5,6,7,...}
false because 3 and 4 is not included in the truth set of x^2 > 4

c. x^2 > 4 -> x > 2
x^2 > 4 = x > sqrt(4) or x < sqrt(-4) = {...,-7,-6,-5,5,6,7,...}
x > 2 = {3,4,5,...}

x           x^2           x^2 > 4?     x>2?              
-5          25            T            F         
5           25            T            T         
-10         100           T            F         
10          100           T            T         

I think this one is false because if you input (-5 or -10 as shown in the table above), the conslusion becomes false and this makes the whole implication false.

d. x^2 > 4 <-> |x| > 2
x^2 > 4 = x > 2 or x < 2 = {...,-5,-4,-3,3,4,5,...}
|x| > 2 = x < 2 or x > 2 = {...,-5,-4,-3,3,4,5,...}

x        x^2       x^2 > 4?     |x| > 2
5        25        T            T      
-5       25        T            T      
10       100       T            T      
-10      100       T            T      

we have to find one where |x| > 2 is false
since theres' nothing that satisties that, the implication is true.

Let R be the domain of the predicate variables a, 
b, c, and d. Which of the following are true and 
which are false? Give counterexamples for the 
statements that are false. 
a.  a > 0 AND b > 0 -> ab > 0

a > 0 = {1,2,3,...}
b > 0 = {1,2,3,...}

ab > 0 = {1,4,9...}
theres no counterexample of this since ab > 0 is all positive
so it's true

b. a < 0 and b < 0 -> ab < 0
a < 0 = {....-3,-2,-1}
b < 0 = {....-3,-2,-1}

ab < 0 = {..,9,4,1}
counterexample = -2 x -2 = 4 which is NOT < 0 so this is false 

c. ab = 0 => a = 0 OR b = 0
ab = 0
a = 0 OR b = 0
counterexample, we need to find a value such that a = 0 OR b = 0 is false and ab = 0 must be true


1 = 0 OR 1 = 0 which is false, but this makes ab = 0 false also false
this is impossible so no counterexample can be found. therfore this statement is true


d. a < b and c < d -> ac < bd
a < b AND c < d

for the counterexample, we need to find a case where a < b AND c < d is true
but ac < bd is false

let a = 1, b = 2, c = 1, and d = 0
a < b AND c < d -> ac < bd
1 < 2 AND 1 < 0 -> 1x1 < 2x0
true AND false -> 1 < 0 false
false -> false - not a counterexample

let a = -1, b = -2, c = 1, and d = 0
a < b AND c < d -> ac < bd
-1 < -2 AND 1 < 0 -> -1x1 < 2x0
false AND true -> -1 < 0 true
false -> false - not a counterexample

let a = -2, b = -1, c = 1, and d = 3
a < b AND c < d -> ac < bd
-2 < -1 AND 1 < 3 -> -2x1 < -1x3
true AND true -> -2 < -3 true
true -> false - this is a counterexample, so the statement is false
