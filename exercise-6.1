Exercise 6.1

Test yourself

1. to prove that a set X is a subset of a set A A B,
you suppose that x is any element ofX and you show that 
X E A ___ X E B
answer: and

2. to prove that a set X is a subset of a set A U B,
you suppose that x is any element ofX and you show that 
X E A ___ X E B
answer: or

3. to prove that a set A U B is a subset of X,
you start with any element x in A U B and consider the two cases
___ and ___. you then show that in either case ___
answer: x E a and x E B. x E X

4. to prove that a set A A B is a subset of X,
you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: x E A A B, x E X

5. to prove that set X equals a set Y, you prove that 
____ and ____
answer:X is a subset of Y and Y is a subset of X

6. to prove that a set X does not equal a set Y, you need to find an element
that is in ___ and not ___ or that is in ___ and not ____
answer: X Y, Y X

Exercise set 6.2
1a. to say that an element is in A A (B U C)
means that it is in (1) and in (2)
answer: A, B U C

b. to say an element is in (A A B) U C means that it is in (1) or in (2)
answer: (A A B), C

c. to say an element is in A - (B A C means that it is in (1) and not in (2)
answer: A, B A C

d.  To prove that (A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C), 
we suppose that x is any element in (1) Then 
we must show that (2)
answer: (A U B) A C, x E A U (B A C)

e. if A,B,C are any sets such that B is a subset of C,
to prove that A A B is a subset of A A C, we suppose that 
x is any element in (1), then we must show that (2)
answer: A A B, x E A A C

2. the following are two proofs that for all sets A and B,
A - B is a subset of A. the first is less formal, and the second is more formal.
fill in the blanks.
a. proof:
Proof: Suppose A and B are any sets. To show 
that A - B is a subset of A, we must show that every ele
ment in (1) is in (2)
But any element in A - B is in (3) and not in (4)
(by definition of A2B). In particular, such an element is in A.
answer:
1. A - B,
2. A
3. A
4. B

b. proof: 
Suppose A and B are any sets and 
x E A - B. [We must show that (1)] By defini
tion of set difference, x E (2)  and x is not an element of (3). 
In particular, x E (4) which is what was to be 
shown]. 
answer: 
1.x E A
2.A
3.B
4.A
