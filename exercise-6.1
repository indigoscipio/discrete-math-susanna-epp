Exercise 6.1

Test yourself

1. to prove that a set X is a subset of a set A A B,
you suppose that x is any element ofX and you show that 
X E A ___ X E B
answer: and

2. to prove that a set X is a subset of a set A U B,
you suppose that x is any element ofX and you show that 
X E A ___ X E B
answer: or

3. to prove that a set A U B is a subset of X,
you start with any element x in A U B and consider the two cases
___ and ___. you then show that in either case ___
answer: x E a and x E B. x E X

4. to prove that a set A A B is a subset of X,
you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: x E A A B, x E X

5. to prove that set X equals a set Y, you prove that 
____ and ____
answer:X is a subset of Y and Y is a subset of X

6. to prove that a set X does not equal a set Y, you need to find an element
that is in ___ and not ___ or that is in ___ and not ____
answer: X Y, Y X

Exercise set 6.2
1a. to say that an element is in A A (B U C)
means that it is in (1) and in (2)
answer: A, B U C

b. to say an element is in (A A B) U C means that it is in (1) or in (2)
answer: (A A B), C

c. to say an element is in A - (B A C means that it is in (1) and not in (2)
answer: A, B A C

d.  To prove that (A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C), 
we suppose that x is any element in (1) Then 
we must show that (2)
answer: (A U B) A C, x E A U (B A C)

e. if A,B,C are any sets such that B is a subset of C,
to prove that A A B is a subset of A A C, we suppose that 
x is any element in (1), then we must show that (2)
answer:

2. the following are two proofs that for all sets A and B,
A - B is a subset of A. the first is less formal, and the second is more formal.
fill in the blanks.
a. proof:
b. proof:
