Exercise set 6.2
1a. to say that an element is in A A (B U C)
means that it is in (1) and in (2)

2. the following are two proofs that for all sets A and B,
A - B is a subset of A. the first is less formal, and the second is more formal.
fill in the blanks.
a. proof:
Proof: Suppose A and B are any sets. To show 
that A - B is a subset of A, we must show that every ele
ment in (1) is in (2)
But any element in A - B is in (3) and not in (4)
(by definition of A2B). In particular, such an element is in A.
answer:
1. A - B,
2. A
3. A
4. B

b. proof: 
Suppose A and B are any sets and 
x E A - B. [We must show that (1)] By defini
tion of set difference, x E (2)  and x is not an element of (3). 
In particular, x E (4) which is what was to be 
shown]. 
answer: 
1.x E A
2.A
3.B
4.A

in 3 and 4, supply explanations of the steps in the given proof
3. theorem: for all stes A,B,and C, if A is a subset of B, B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C
proof:

Statement - Explanation
Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that A C (is a subset of ) B and B C C - starting point
we must show that A C C - conclusion to be shown
let x be any element in A - start of an element proof
then x is in b - (a)
it follows that x is in c - (b)
thus every element in a is in c - (since x could be any element of a)
therefore, A C C [as was to be shown] - (c)

answer:
a. by the definition of subset (A C B)
b. since B is a subset of C
c.  by the definition of a subset/transitivity

4. theorem: for all sets a and b, if A C (is a subset of) B,
then A U B C B
proof:
Statement - Explanation
Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that A C B - starting point
we must show that A U B C B - conclusion to be shown
let x be any element in A U B - start of an element proof
then x is in A or x is in B - (a)
in case x is in A, then x is in b - (b)
in case x is in b, then x is in b - tautology p -> p
so in either case x is in b - proof by division into cases
thus every element in A U B is in B - since x culd be any element of A U B
therefore, A U B C B [as was to be shown] - (c)

answer:
a. by the definition of union
b. by the definition of a subset (A C B)
c. by the definition of subset

5. prove that for all sets of A and B, (B - A) = B A A^c

first we need to prove B - A is a subset of B A A^C

First Part
step 1:
let x be any element of B - A
by the definition of -, x is not in a
but x is in b

step 2: connect the right side
by the definition of intersect, x must be in both B and A^c
but A^c means x is not in A
so x is in b

this means (B - A is a subset of B A A^c

Second Part
step 1:
let x be any element of B A A^c
by the definitino of intersect, x must be in both B and A^C
but thedefinition of complement said its not in A,
so X is in B

step 2:
let x be any element of B - A
by the definition of -, x is in b and x is not in a
so x is in b

since the two are equal, B A A^c is a subset of B - A
therefore we've proven both parts and theefore equal


6. let A and U stand for the words "intersection" and "union" respectiveyl
fill in the blanks in the following proof that for all sets a,b,and c,

A A (B U C) = (A A B) U (A A C)

Proof: Suppose A, B, and C are any sets.

(1) Proof that A ∩ (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C):
Let x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C). [We must show that x ∈ ___(a)___].

By definition of ∩, x ∈ ___(b)___ and x ∈ B ∪ C.
Thus x ∈ A and, by definition of ∪, x ∈ B or ___(c)___.

Case 1 (x ∈ A and x ∈ B): In this case, x ∈ A ∩ B by definition of ∩.

Case 2 (x ∈ A and x ∈ C): In this case, x ∈ A ∩ C by definition of ∩.

By cases 1 and 2, x ∈ A ∩ B or x ∈ A ∩ C, and so, by definition of ∪, ___(d)___.

[So A ∩ (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) by definition of subset.]

(2) Proof that (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ⊆ A ∩ (B ∪ C):
Let x ∈ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). [We must show that x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C).]

By definition of ∪, x ∈ A ∩ B ___(a)___ x ∈ A ∩ C.

Case 1 (x ∈ A ∩ B): In this case, by definition of ∩, x ∈ A and x ∈ B.
Since x ∈ B, then x ∈ B ∪ C by definition of ∪.

Case 2 (x ∈ A ∩ C): In this case, by definition of ∩, x ∈ A ___(b)___ x ∈ C.
Since x ∈ C, then x ∈ B ∪ C by definition of ∪.

In both cases x ∈ A and x ∈ B ∪ C, and so, by definition of ∩, ___(c)___.

[So (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ⊆ A ∩ (B ∪ C) by definition of ⊆.]

(3) Conclusion: [Since both subset relations have been proved, it follows, by definition of set equality, that (a).]


answer:
1a) (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C):
1b) A
1c) C
1d) x is in (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

2a) or
2b) and
2c) x is in a and x is in B U C
2d) subset

3a) A A (B U C) = (A A B) U (A A C)

use an element argument to prove each statement in 7 - 22.
assume that all sets are subsets of a universal set U

7. for all sets A and B, (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c

suppose a and b are any sets, and x E (A A B)^c
we want to show that (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c, that is

(A A B)^c is a subset of A^C U B^c, and
A^C U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.

Part 1: show that (A A B)^c is a subset of A^C U B^c
by the definition of complement, it is not the case that (x is in both A and B)
so X is not in A or x is not in B -> A^c U B ^c
this also fits morgan's law = (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c

part 2: show that A^c U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.
by the definition of union, x is in A^c or B^c
by the definition of complement, it is not the case that x is in A or it is not the case that x is in B
this is equal to (A A B)^c by morgan's law
therefore A^C U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.

therefore the two sets are equal


8. for all sets A and B, (A A B) U (A A B^c) = A
(this property is used in section 9.9)

suppose a and b are any sets, and x E (A A B) U (A A B^c)
we want to show (A A B) U (A A B^c) = A,
that is, we want to show that
1. (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of (A A B) U (A A B^c)

part 1: show that (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A
assume that x is in (A A B) U (A A B^c)
by the definition of union, x is in (A A B) or (A A B^c)
A A B -> by the definition of intersect, x is both in A and B.
(A A B^c) -> by the definition of complement, x is not in B. but its intersect so x is not in B.
so x is in A

therefore, (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A.

part 2: show that A is a subset of (A A B) U (A A B^c)
assume that x is in A.

case 1: if x E B: then x E A and x E B
so x E A A B

case 2: if x is not an element of B, then x E B^c
since x E A, x E A A B^c

in either case, x E A A B U A A B^c

9. for all sets A,B, and C
(A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x E (A - B) U (C - B)
we must show (A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B, that is
we must show the following:

1. (A - B) U (C - B) is a subest of  (A U C) - B
2. (A U C) - B is a subset of (A - B) U (C - B)

part 1: show that (A - B) U (C - B) is a subest of (A U C) - B
asume that x is in (A - B) U (C - B)

case 1: assume x is in (A - B)
this means x is in A and x is not in B
does the conclusion (A U C) - B follows?
(A U C) -> since x is in a, this is true by definition of union
- B -> x is not in B so its true

case 2: assume x is in (C - B)
this means x is in C but not in B
does the conclusion (A U C) - B follows?
this means (A U C) -> since x is in C, is true by definition of union
and x is not in B, so this is true

part 2: show that (A U C) - B is a subset of (A - B) U (C - B)
assume that x is in (A U C) - B
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in C
by the definition of differnce, x is not in B

case 1: x is in A
(A - B) U (C - B)
since we know x is not in B, the first part is true (A - B)
therefore by definition of union there only neesd to be 1 true the whole thing true

case 2: x is in C
(A - B) U (C - B)
since we know x is not in B, the second part is true (C - B)
therefore by definition of union there only neesd to be 1 true the whole thing true

since we proved two parts, therefore  (A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B


10. for all sets A,B, and C,
(A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C)

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x (A U B) A C
we must show that x is in A U (B A C)

by the definition of intersect, x is in (A U B) and x is in C

case 1: x is in A
A U (B A C)
since we know x is in A, then by the definition of union, the 1st part is true and
therefore the whole thing is true.

case 2: x is in B
A U (B A C)
by the definition of intersect, x is in B and x is in C
since we assumed earlier that x is in C, therefore the 2nd expression (B A C) istrue
and by the definitino of union, this makes the whole expression true

Since the conclusion holds for both cases, (A∪B)∩C is a subset of A∪(B∩C).

11. for all sets A, B, and C,
A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x A A (B - C) 
we must show that x is in (A A B) - (A A C)

assume that x E A A (B - C) 
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in (B - C)
by thedefinition of difference, x is in B and x is not in C
so x is in A and x is in B, but x is not in C.
this is what we know so far

(A A B) - (A A C)
(A A B) -> since we know x is in A and x is in B, therefore this part is correct
(A A C) -> by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in C - so this part is false

and by the definition of negation,  - (A A C) makes it true
therefore the whole expression is true

12. for all sets a, b, and c
(A U B) - C is a subset of (A - C) U (B - C)

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x E (A U B) - C
we must show x E (A - C) U (B - C)

by the definition of difference x is not in C
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in B

case 1: x is in A
does the conclusion (A - C) U (B - C) follows?
(A - C) U (B - C)
1st part -> since we know x is in A and x is not in C. therefore this first part is true
and by the definiton of union, we odn't need to check the 2nd part since 1stp art alredy true

case 2: x is in B
(A - C) U (B - C)
2dn part -> since we know that x is in b and x is not in C, therefore this part is true
and by the definiton of union, we odn't need to check the 1nd part since 2stp art alredy true

therefore since we prove both cases its true


13. for all sets a,b,andc,
(A - B) A (C - B) = (A A C) - B 

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x E (A - B) A (C - B)
we must show that (A - B) A (C - B) = (A A C) - B 
that is, we must show 2 things:

1. (A - B) A (C - B) is a subset of (A A C) - B 
2. (A A C) - B  is a subset of (A - B) A (C - B)

part 1: show that (A - B) A (C - B) is a subset of (A A C) - B
assume that x E (A - B) A (C - B) 
we must show that x E (A A C) - B 

by the definition of intersect, x is in (A - B) and x is in (C - B) 
by the definition of difference, x is not in B
so x is in A and x is in C but x is not in B
these are the things we know so far.

(A A C) - B 
by the defintion of intersect, x is in A and x is in C
since we assumed earlier that x is in A and x is in C, the first part is true (A A C)
and since we also know that x is not in B, the - B part is also true
therefore the whole expression is true

part 2: show that (A A C) - B  is a subset of (A - B) A (C - B)
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in C
and by the definition of difference, x is not in B


14. for all sets a and b, A U (A A B) = A

suppose a, and b are any sets and x E A U (A A B)
we must show that A U (A A B) = A.
that is , we must show 2 things:
1. A U (A A B) is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of  A U (A A B)

part 1: show that  A U (A A B) is a subset of A
assume x is an element of A U (A A B)

by the definitino of union, x is in A or x is in (A A B)
case 1: x is in A
since x is in A, then in this case A U (A A B) is a subset of A

case 2:x is in (A A B)
by the definitino of intersect, x is in A and x is in B
sinec we know that x is in A therefore in this case A U (A A B) is a subset of A

part 2: show that A is a subset of A U (A A B)
assume x is in A
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in (A A B)
since we know that x is in A, then by the definition of union A is a subset of A U (A A B)


15, for eveyr set A , A U O (the empty set) = A

suppse a is any set and x E (A U O)
we must show that A U O (the empty set) = A
that is, we must show 2 things:
1. A U O is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of A U O

part 1: A U O is a subset of A
asume x E A U O.
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in O (the empty set)

case 1: x is in A
in this case, since x is in A, then A U O is a subset of A by the definition of union

case 2: x is is in O
in this case, since x is in O its not possible because empty set is always empty
therefore case 2 is impossible

since case 2 is impossible and case 1 is true, the nby definition of union A U O is a subset of A by just
using case 1

part 2: A is a subset of A U O
assume x E A
therefore by the definition of union, A is a subset of A U O

since we proved two parts its proven
