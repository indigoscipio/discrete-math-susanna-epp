Exercise set 6.2
1a. to say that an element is in A A (B U C)
means that it is in (1) and in (2)
answer: A, B U C

b. to say an element is in (A A B) U C means that it is in (1) or in (2)
answer: (A A B), C

c. to say an element is in A - (B A C means that it is in (1) and not in (2)
answer: A, B A C

d.  To prove that (A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C), 
we suppose that x is any element in (1) Then 
we must show that (2)
answer: (A U B) A C, x E A U (B A C)

e. if A,B,C are any sets such that B is a subset of C,

2. the following are two proofs that for all sets A and B,
A - B is a subset of A. the first is less formal, and the second is more formal.
fill in the blanks.
a. proof:
Proof: Suppose A and B are any sets. To show 
that A - B is a subset of A, we must show that every ele
ment in (1) is in (2)
But any element in A - B is in (3) and not in (4)
(by definition of A2B). In particular, such an element is in A.
answer:
1. A - B,
2. A
3. A
4. B

b. proof: 
Suppose A and B are any sets and 
x E A - B. [We must show that (1)] By defini
tion of set difference, x E (2)  and x is not an element of (3). 
In particular, x E (4) which is what was to be 
shown]. 
answer: 
1.x E A
2.A
3.B
4.A

in 3 and 4, supply explanations of the steps in the given proof
3. theorem: for all stes A,B,and C, if A is a subset of B, B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C
proof:

Statement - Explanation
Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that A C (is a subset of ) B and B C C - starting point
we must show that A C C - conclusion to be shown
let x be any element in A - start of an element proof
then x is in b - (a)
it follows that x is in c - (b)
thus every element in a is in c - (since x could be any element of a)
therefore, A C C [as was to be shown] - (c)

answer:
a. by the definition of subset (A C B)
b. since B is a subset of C
c.  by the definition of a subset/transitivity

4. theorem: for all sets a and b, if A C (is a subset of) B,
then A U B C B
proof:
Statement - Explanation
Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that A C B - starting point
we must show that A U B C B - conclusion to be shown
let x be any element in A U B - start of an element proof
then x is in A or x is in B - (a)
in case x is in A, then x is in b - (b)
in case x is in b, then x is in b - tautology p -> p
so in either case x is in b - proof by division into cases
thus every element in A U B is in B - since x culd be any element of A U B
therefore, A U B C B [as was to be shown] - (c)

answer:
a. by the definition of union
b. by the definition of a subset (A C B)
c. by the definition of subset

5. prove that for all sets of A and B, (B - A) = B A A^c

first we need to prove B - A is a subset of B A A^C

First Part
step 1:
let x be any element of B - A
by the definition of -, x is not in a
but x is in b

step 2: connect the right side
by the definition of intersect, x must be in both B and A^c
but A^c means x is not in A
so x is in b

this means (B - A is a subset of B A A^c

Second Part
step 1:
let x be any element of B A A^c
by the definitino of intersect, x must be in both B and A^C
but thedefinition of complement said its not in A,
so X is in B

step 2:
let x be any element of B - A
by the definition of -, x is in b and x is not in a
so x is in b

since the two are equal, B A A^c is a subset of B - A
therefore we've proven both parts and theefore equal


6. let A and U stand for the words "intersection" and "union" respectiveyl
fill in the blanks in the following proof that for all sets a,b,and c,

A A (B U C) = (A A B) U (A A C)

Proof: Suppose A, B, and C are any sets.

(1) Proof that A ∩ (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C):
Let x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C). [We must show that x ∈ ___(a)___].

By definition of ∩, x ∈ ___(b)___ and x ∈ B ∪ C.
Thus x ∈ A and, by definition of ∪, x ∈ B or ___(c)___.

Case 1 (x ∈ A and x ∈ B): In this case, x ∈ A ∩ B by definition of ∩.

Case 2 (x ∈ A and x ∈ C): In this case, x ∈ A ∩ C by definition of ∩.

By cases 1 and 2, x ∈ A ∩ B or x ∈ A ∩ C, and so, by definition of ∪, ___(d)___.

[So A ∩ (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) by definition of subset.]

(2) Proof that (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ⊆ A ∩ (B ∪ C):
Let x ∈ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). [We must show that x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C).]

By definition of ∪, x ∈ A ∩ B ___(a)___ x ∈ A ∩ C.

Case 1 (x ∈ A ∩ B): In this case, by definition of ∩, x ∈ A and x ∈ B.
Since x ∈ B, then x ∈ B ∪ C by definition of ∪.

Case 2 (x ∈ A ∩ C): In this case, by definition of ∩, x ∈ A ___(b)___ x ∈ C.
Since x ∈ C, then x ∈ B ∪ C by definition of ∪.

In both cases x ∈ A and x ∈ B ∪ C, and so, by definition of ∩, ___(c)___.

[So (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ⊆ A ∩ (B ∪ C) by definition of ⊆.]

(3) Conclusion: [Since both subset relations have been proved, it follows, by definition of set equality, that (a).]


answer:
1a) (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C):
1b) A
1c) C
1d) x is in (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

2a) or
2b) and
2c) x is in a and x is in B U C
2d) subset

3a) A A (B U C) = (A A B) U (A A C)

use an element argument to prove each statement in 7 - 22.
assume that all sets are subsets of a universal set U

7. for all sets A and B, (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c

suppose a and b are any sets, and x E (A A B)^c
we want to show that (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c, that is

(A A B)^c is a subset of A^C U B^c, and
A^C U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.

Part 1: show that (A A B)^c is a subset of A^C U B^c
by the definition of complement, it is not the case that (x is in both A and B)
so X is not in A or x is not in B -> A^c U B ^c
this also fits morgan's law = (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c

part 2: show that A^c U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.
by the definition of union, x is in A^c or B^c
by the definition of complement, it is not the case that x is in A or it is not the case that x is in B
this is equal to (A A B)^c by morgan's law
therefore A^C U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.

therefore the two sets are equal


8. for all sets A and B, (A A B) U (A A B^c) = A
(this property is used in section 9.9)

suppose a and b are any sets, and x E (A A B) U (A A B^c)
we want to show (A A B) U (A A B^c) = A,
that is, we want to show that
1. (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of (A A B) U (A A B^c)

part 1: show that (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A
assume that x is in (A A B) U (A A B^c)
by the definition of union, x is in (A A B) or (A A B^c)
A A B -> by the definition of intersect, x is both in A and B.
(A A B^c) -> by the definition of complement, x is not in B. but its intersect so x is not in B.
so x is in A

therefore, (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A.

part 2: show that A is a subset of (A A B) U (A A B^c)
assume that x is in A.

case 1: if x E B: then x E A and x E B
so x E A A B

case 2: if x is not an element of B, then x E B^c
since x E A, x E A A B^c

in either case, x E A A B U A A B^c

9. for all sets A,B, and C
(A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x E (A - B) U (C - B)
we must show (A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B, that is
we must show the following:

1. (A - B) U (C - B) is a subest of  (A U C) - B
2. (A U C) - B is a subset of (A - B) U (C - B)

part 1: show that (A - B) U (C - B) is a subest of (A U C) - B
asume that x is in (A - B) U (C - B)

case 1: assume x is in (A - B)
this means x is in A and x is not in B
does the conclusion (A U C) - B follows?
(A U C) -> since x is in a, this is true by definition of union
- B -> x is not in B so its true

case 2: assume x is in (C - B)
this means x is in C but not in B
does the conclusion (A U C) - B follows?
this means (A U C) -> since x is in C, is true by definition of union
and x is not in B, so this is true

part 2: show that (A U C) - B is a subset of (A - B) U (C - B)
assume that x is in (A U C) - B
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in C
by the definition of differnce, x is not in B

case 1: x is in A
(A - B) U (C - B)
since we know x is not in B, the first part is true (A - B)
therefore by definition of union there only neesd to be 1 true the whole thing true

case 2: x is in C
(A - B) U (C - B)
since we know x is not in B, the second part is true (C - B)
therefore by definition of union there only neesd to be 1 true the whole thing true

since we proved two parts, therefore  (A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B


10. for all sets A,B, and C,
(A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C)

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x (A U B) A C
we must show that x is in A U (B A C)

by the definition of intersect, x is in (A U B) and x is in C

case 1: x is in A
A U (B A C)
since we know x is in A, then by the definition of union, the 1st part is true and
therefore the whole thing is true.

case 2: x is in B
A U (B A C)
by the definition of intersect, x is in B and x is in C
since we assumed earlier that x is in C, therefore the 2nd expression (B A C) istrue
and by the definitino of union, this makes the whole expression true

Since the conclusion holds for both cases, (A∪B)∩C is a subset of A∪(B∩C).

11. for all sets A, B, and C,
A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x A A (B - C) 
we must show that x is in (A A B) - (A A C)

assume that x E A A (B - C) 
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in (B - C)
by thedefinition of difference, x is in B and x is not in C
so x is in A and x is in B, but x is not in C.
this is what we know so far

(A A B) - (A A C)
(A A B) -> since we know x is in A and x is in B, therefore this part is correct
(A A C) -> by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in C - so this part is false

and by the definition of negation,  - (A A C) makes it true
therefore the whole expression is true

12. for all sets a, b, and c
(A U B) - C is a subset of (A - C) U (B - C)

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x E (A U B) - C
we must show x E (A - C) U (B - C)

by the definition of difference x is not in C
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in B

case 1: x is in A
does the conclusion (A - C) U (B - C) follows?
(A - C) U (B - C)
1st part -> since we know x is in A and x is not in C. therefore this first part is true
and by the definiton of union, we odn't need to check the 2nd part since 1stp art alredy true

case 2: x is in B
(A - C) U (B - C)
2dn part -> since we know that x is in b and x is not in C, therefore this part is true
and by the definiton of union, we odn't need to check the 1nd part since 2stp art alredy true

therefore since we prove both cases its true


13. for all sets a,b,andc,
(A - B) A (C - B) = (A A C) - B 

suppose a, b, and c are any sets and x E (A - B) A (C - B)
we must show that (A - B) A (C - B) = (A A C) - B 
that is, we must show 2 things:

1. (A - B) A (C - B) is a subset of (A A C) - B 
2. (A A C) - B  is a subset of (A - B) A (C - B)

part 1: show that (A - B) A (C - B) is a subset of (A A C) - B
assume that x E (A - B) A (C - B) 
we must show that x E (A A C) - B 

by the definition of intersect, x is in (A - B) and x is in (C - B) 
by the definition of difference, x is not in B
so x is in A and x is in C but x is not in B
these are the things we know so far.

(A A C) - B 
by the defintion of intersect, x is in A and x is in C
since we assumed earlier that x is in A and x is in C, the first part is true (A A C)
and since we also know that x is not in B, the - B part is also true
therefore the whole expression is true

part 2: show that (A A C) - B  is a subset of (A - B) A (C - B)
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in C
and by the definition of difference, x is not in B


14. for all sets a and b, A U (A A B) = A

suppose a, and b are any sets and x E A U (A A B)
we must show that A U (A A B) = A.
that is , we must show 2 things:
1. A U (A A B) is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of  A U (A A B)

part 1: show that  A U (A A B) is a subset of A
assume x is an element of A U (A A B)

by the definitino of union, x is in A or x is in (A A B)
case 1: x is in A
since x is in A, then in this case A U (A A B) is a subset of A

case 2:x is in (A A B)
by the definitino of intersect, x is in A and x is in B
sinec we know that x is in A therefore in this case A U (A A B) is a subset of A

part 2: show that A is a subset of A U (A A B)
assume x is in A
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in (A A B)
since we know that x is in A, then by the definition of union A is a subset of A U (A A B)


15, for eveyr set A , A U O (the empty set) = A

suppse a is any set and x E (A U O)
we must show that A U O (the empty set) = A
that is, we must show 2 things:
1. A U O is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of A U O

part 1: A U O is a subset of A
asume x E A U O.
by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in O (the empty set)

case 1: x is in A
in this case, since x is in A, then A U O is a subset of A by the definition of union

case 2: x is is in O
in this case, since x is in O its not possible because empty set is always empty
therefore case 2 is impossible

since case 2 is impossible and case 1 is true, the nby definition of union A U O is a subset of A by just
using case 1

part 2: A is a subset of A U O
assume x E A
therefore by the definition of union, A is a subset of A U O

since we proved two parts its proven

16. for all sets A, B, and C, if A is a subset of B, then A A C is a subset of B A C

suppose a, b , and c are any sets and A is a subset of B
we must show A A C is a subset of B A C

let x be any elmeent in A A C
by the definition of intersection, x is in A and x is in C

B A C
by the definition of intersect, x is in B and x is in C

since we know that A is a subset of B, then x must be in B.
therefore since x is in B and x is in C, x E B A C

17. for all sets A, B, and C, if A is a subset of B, then A U C is a subset of B U C

suppose a,b, and c are any sets and A is a subset of B
we must show that A U C is a subset of B U C

by the definition of subset, since A is a subset of B, then x is in B.
so x is in B.

A U C is a subset of B U C
assume x E A U C - we must show x E B U C

by the definition of union, x is in A or x is in C

case 1: x is in A
B U C
we dont have A here but by the defintiion of union, x is in B or x is in C
since we know that x is in B, then by the definition of union, x is in B U C

case 2: x is in C
B U C
since we know x is in C, therefore by the defintiion of union, x E B U C

since the conslusion hold for both case,   therefore proven


18. for all sets A, and B, if A is a subset of B, then B^c is a subset of A^c
suppose a,b,and c are any sets and x is A subset of B

we must show that B^c is a subset of A^c
let x be any element in B^c
by the definition of complement, x is not in b

from the premise we know that A is a subset of B  (every element in A is also in B)
but we know that x is not in B, therefore x can not in A
therefore x E A^c


19. For all sets A, B, and C, if A is a subset of B and A is a subset of C then A is a subset of B A C

suupose a,b and c are any sets and A is a subset of B and A is a subset of C

we must show that A is a subset of B A C

let x be any element in A
from the premise we know A is a subset of B and A is a subset of C
so x E B and x E C

by the definition of intersection, this means B A C
since every element in A is also an element in B A C, therefore proven


20. for all sets A, B and C, if A is a subset of C and B is a subset of C then A U B is a subset of C
suppose a,b , and c are any sets and a is a subset of C and B is a subset of C

we must show that A U B is a subset of C

let x be any element in A U B

case 1: x is in A
show that x is in C
from the premise we know that A is a subset of C
therefore every element in A is also in C, therefore x E C

case 2: x is in B
we must show that x is in C
from the premise we know that B is a subset of C
therefore every element in B is also in C, therefore x E C

in either case x E C, therefore provem

21. for all sts A, B, and C,

A x (B U C) = (A x B) U (A x C)

suppose a,b , and c are any sets and A x (B U C)
we need tos how that A x (B U C) = (A x B) U (A x C)

that is, we need to show 2 things:
1. A x (B U C) is a subset of (A x B) U (A x C)
2. (A x B) U (A x C) is a subset of A x (B U C)

part 1: show that A x (B U C) is a subset of (A x B) U (A x C)

let x,y be any element in A x (B U C)
by the definition of cartesian product, this mean

1. x E A
2. y E (B U C) -> this means y is in B or y is in C

case 1: y is in B
since x is in A and y is in B, by the definition of cartesian this means
(A x B)

case 2: y is in C
since x is in A and y is in C, by the definitino of catesian product this means
(A x C)

and by the definition of union, x is in (A x B) or x is in (A x C)

part 2: show that (A x B) U (A x C) is a subset of A x (B U C)

let x,y be any element in (A x B) U (A x C)
we must show x is in A x (B U C)

by the definition of union, x is in (A x B) or x is in (A x C)

case 1: x,y is in (A x B)
by the definition of cartesian product, this means:
1. x E A
2. y E B

case 2: x,y is in (A x C)
by the definition of cartesian product, this mean
1. x E A
2. y E C

in either case, x E A and y E B or y E C

since both parts are proven, the whle thing proven


22.  for all sets a,b, and c

A x (B A C) = (A x B) A (A x C)

suppose a,b,and c are any sets and A x (B A C) 
we need to show A x (B A C) = (A x B) A (A x C)

that is, we need to show 2 things:
1. A x (B A C) is a subst of  (A x B) A (A x C)
2. (A x B) A (A x C) is a subst of A x (B A C)

part 1: show that A x (B A C) is a subst of  (A x B) A (A x C)

let (x,y) be any element in A x (B A C)
by the definition of cartesian product, this means
1. x is in A
2. y is in (B A C) - by the definition of intersect, y is in B and y is in C

therfore (x,y) is in (A x B)
and (x,y) is in (A x C)

part 2: (A x B) A (A x C) is a subst of A x (B A C)

let (x,y) be any element in (A x B) A (A x C)
by hte definition of intersect this means
(x,y) is in (A x B) and (x,y) is in (A x C)

(A x B)
by the definitino of cartesian product, x E A and y E B

(A x C)
by the definition of cartesian product, x E A and y E C

in either case, x is in A and y is in B and x is in C
ytherefore proven for bot haprts


23. Find the mistake in the following “proof” that 
for all sets A, B, and C, if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C then 
A ⊆ C.

“Proof:” Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that 
A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C. Since A ⊆ B, there is an element 
x such that x ∈ A and x ∈ B, and since B ⊆ C, 
there is an element x such that x ∈ B and x ∈ C. 
Hence there is an element x such that x ∈ A and 
x ∈ C and so A ⊆ C.


answer: Let x be any arbitrary element in A.
instead of there is an element in X such that ...

24. Find the mistake in the following “proof.”

“Theorem:” For all sets A and B, Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ ⊆ (A ∪ B)ᶜ.

“Proof:” Suppose A and B are any sets, and 
x ∈ Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ. Then x ∈ Aᶜ or x ∈ Bᶜ by definition 
of union. It follows that x ∉ A or x ∉ B by 
definition of complement, and so x ∉ A ∪ B 
by definition of union. Thus x ∈ (A ∪ B)ᶜ 
by definition of complement, and hence 
Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ ⊆ (A ∪ B)ᶜ.

answer: the incorrect part starts from 
"so x is not an element A U B". without proving (A U B)^c. 
it just jumpts to conclusion that x E (A U B)^c
we want to show x E (A U B)^c, so it needs to start from there eg let x be any element x E (A U B)^c... etc

27. Fill in the blanks in the following proof that for all 
sets A and B, (A – B) ∩ (B – A) = ∅.

Proof: Let A and B be any sets and suppose 
(A – B) ∩ (B – A) ≠ ∅. That is, suppose there 
is an element x in (a). By definition of (b), 
x ∈ A – B and x ∈ (c). Then by definition of 
set difference, x ∈ A and x ∉ B and x ∈ (d) 
and x ∉ (e). In particular x ∈ A and x ∉ (f), 
which is a contradiction. Hence [the supposition that 
(A – B) ∩ (B – A) ≠ ∅ is false, and so] (g).

answer:
a) (A – B) ∩ (B – A
b) intersect
c) (B - A)
d) B
e) A

29. For all sets A, B, and C,
    (A – C) ∩ (B – C) ∩ (A – B) = ∅.

answer:
suppose a,b,and c are any sets and x E (A – C) ∩ (B – C) ∩ (A – B)
we must show (A – C) ∩ (B – C) ∩ (A – B) = ∅.

show that (A – C) ∩ (B – C) ∩ (A – B) is a subset of ∅.
let x be any element in (A – C) ∩ (B – C) ∩ (A – B) and assume its not empty
we must show x E the empty set
by the definition of intersect, x is the following:
x E (A - C)
and x E (B - C)
and x E (A - B)

(A - C) -> by the definition of difference, x is in A but not in C
(B - C) -> by the definition of difference, x is in B but not in C
(A - B) ->  by the definition of difference, x is in A but not in B

but this is a contradiction because x cannot be in B but not in B,
since our initial assumptio (set is not empty) leads to a contradiction
therefore the assumption must be false. therefore the set must be empty


30. For every subset A of a universal set U,
    A ∩ Aᶜ = ∅.

suppose a is any sets and x E (A A A^c) and the set is not empty
we must show x E ∅

let x be any element in A ∩ Aᶜ
by the definition of complement, x is not in A
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is not in A
however this is a contradiction since x cannot be in a and not in A

since we found a contradiction, this proves the initial assumption is false
(that the set A A A^c is not empty). So the set must be empty

31. If U denotes a universal set, then Uᶜ = ∅.


32. For every set A, A × ∅ = ∅.

suppose a is any sets and that A x ∅
we ust show A × ∅ = ∅.
we assume opposite assumption -> A × ∅ does not equal ∅.
this means there must be at least one element in the set

by the definition of cartesian product,
(x,y) is in (A x ∅)
so x E A
and y E ∅
but by the definition of empty set, empty set cannot contain any element
therefore we found a contradiction

since the initial assumption (A x ∅ is not empty) leads to a logical impossibility,
the assumption must be false. therefore the set must be empty

33. For all sets A and B, if A ⊆ B then A ∩ Bᶜ = ∅.

34. For all sets A and B, if B ⊆ Aᶜ then A ∩ B = ∅.

35. For all sets A, B, and C, if A ⊆ B and B ∩ C = ∅
    then A ∩ C = ∅.

36. For all sets A, B, and C, if C ⊆ B – A, then
    A ∩ C = ∅.

37. For all sets A, B, and C,
    if B ∩ C ⊆ A, then (C – A) ∩ (B – A) = ∅.

38. For all sets A, B, C, and D,
    if A ∩ C = ∅ then (A × B) ∩ (C × D) = ∅.

Prove each statement in 39–44.

39. For all sets A and B,
    a. (A – B) ∪ (B – A) ∪ (A ∩ B) = A ∪ B
    b. The sets (A – B), (B – A), and (A ∩ B) are
       mutually disjoint.

40. For every positive integer n, if A and B₁, B₂, B₃, … 
    are any sets, then

       A ∩ ( ⋃ (i=1 to n) Bᵢ ) = ⋃ (i=1 to n) (A ∩ Bᵢ).

41. For every positive integer n, if A₁, A₂, A₃, … and B 
    are any sets, then

       ⋃ (i=1 to n) (Aᵢ – B) = ( ⋃ (i=1 to n) Aᵢ ) – B.

42. For every positive integer n, if A₁, A₂, A₃, … and B 
    are any sets, then

       ⋂ (i=1 to n) (Aᵢ – B) = ( ⋂ (i=1 to n) Aᵢ ) – B.
