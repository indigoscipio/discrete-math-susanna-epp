Exercise set 6.2
1a. to say that an element is in A A (B U C)
means that it is in (1) and in (2)
answer: A, B U C

b. to say an element is in (A A B) U C means that it is in (1) or in (2)
answer: (A A B), C

c. to say an element is in A - (B A C means that it is in (1) and not in (2)
answer: A, B A C

d.  To prove that (A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C), 
we suppose that x is any element in (1) Then 
we must show that (2)
answer: (A U B) A C, x E A U (B A C)

e. if A,B,C are any sets such that B is a subset of C,
to prove that A A B is a subset of A A C, we suppose that 
x is any element in (1), then we must show that (2)

2. the following are two proofs that for all sets A and B,
A - B is a subset of A. the first is less formal, and the second is more formal.
fill in the blanks.
a. proof:
Proof: Suppose A and B are any sets. To show 
that A - B is a subset of A, we must show that every ele
ment in (1) is in (2)
But any element in A - B is in (3) and not in (4)
(by definition of A2B). In particular, such an element is in A.
answer:
1. A - B,
2. A
3. A
4. B

b. proof: 
Suppose A and B are any sets and 
x E A - B. [We must show that (1)] By defini
tion of set difference, x E (2)  and x is not an element of (3). 
In particular, x E (4) which is what was to be 
shown]. 
answer: 
1.x E A
2.A
3.B
4.A

in 3 and 4, supply explanations of the steps in the given proof
3. theorem: for all stes A,B,and C, if A is a subset of B, B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C
proof:

Statement - Explanation
Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that A C (is a subset of ) B and B C C - starting point
we must show that A C C - conclusion to be shown
let x be any element in A - start of an element proof
then x is in b - (a)
it follows that x is in c - (b)
thus every element in a is in c - (since x could be any element of a)
therefore, A C C [as was to be shown] - (c)

answer:
a. by the definition of subset (A C B)
b. since B is a subset of C
c.  by the definition of a subset/transitivity

4. theorem: for all sets a and b, if A C (is a subset of) B,
then A U B C B
proof:
Statement - Explanation
Suppose A, B, and C are any sets such that A C B - starting point
we must show that A U B C B - conclusion to be shown
let x be any element in A U B - start of an element proof
then x is in A or x is in B - (a)
in case x is in A, then x is in b - (b)
in case x is in b, then x is in b - tautology p -> p
so in either case x is in b - proof by division into cases
thus every element in A U B is in B - since x culd be any element of A U B
therefore, A U B C B [as was to be shown] - (c)

answer:
a. by the definition of union
b. by the definition of a subset (A C B)
c. by the definition of subset

5. prove that for all sets of A and B, (B - A) = B A A^c

first we need to prove B - A is a subset of B A A^C

First Part
step 1:
let x be any element of B - A
by the definition of -, x is not in a
but x is in b

step 2: connect the right side
by the definition of intersect, x must be in both B and A^c
but A^c means x is not in A
so x is in b

this means (B - A is a subset of B A A^c

Second Part
step 1:
let x be any element of B A A^c
by the definitino of intersect, x must be in both B and A^C
but thedefinition of complement said its not in A,
so X is in B

step 2:
let x be any element of B - A
by the definition of -, x is in b and x is not in a
so x is in b

since the two are equal, B A A^c is a subset of B - A
therefore we've proven both parts and theefore equal


6. let A and U stand for the words "intersection" and "union" respectiveyl
fill in the blanks in the following proof that for all sets a,b,and c,

A A (B U C) = (A A B) U (A A C)

Proof: Suppose A, B, and C are any sets.

(1) Proof that A ∩ (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C):
Let x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C). [We must show that x ∈ ___(a)___].

By definition of ∩, x ∈ ___(b)___ and x ∈ B ∪ C.
Thus x ∈ A and, by definition of ∪, x ∈ B or ___(c)___.

Case 1 (x ∈ A and x ∈ B): In this case, x ∈ A ∩ B by definition of ∩.

Case 2 (x ∈ A and x ∈ C): In this case, x ∈ A ∩ C by definition of ∩.

By cases 1 and 2, x ∈ A ∩ B or x ∈ A ∩ C, and so, by definition of ∪, ___(d)___.

[So A ∩ (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) by definition of subset.]

(2) Proof that (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ⊆ A ∩ (B ∪ C):
Let x ∈ (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). [We must show that x ∈ A ∩ (B ∪ C).]

By definition of ∪, x ∈ A ∩ B ___(a)___ x ∈ A ∩ C.

Case 1 (x ∈ A ∩ B): In this case, by definition of ∩, x ∈ A and x ∈ B.
Since x ∈ B, then x ∈ B ∪ C by definition of ∪.

Case 2 (x ∈ A ∩ C): In this case, by definition of ∩, x ∈ A ___(b)___ x ∈ C.
Since x ∈ C, then x ∈ B ∪ C by definition of ∪.

In both cases x ∈ A and x ∈ B ∪ C, and so, by definition of ∩, ___(c)___.

[So (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ⊆ A ∩ (B ∪ C) by definition of ⊆.]

(3) Conclusion: [Since both subset relations have been proved, it follows, by definition of set equality, that (a).]


answer:
1a) (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C):
1b) A
1c) C
1d) x is in (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

2a) or
2b) and
2c) x is in a and x is in B U C
2d) subset

3a) A A (B U C) = (A A B) U (A A C)

use an element argument to prove each statement in 7 - 22.
assume that all sets are subsets of a universal set U

7. for all sets A and B, (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c

suppose a and b are any sets, and x E (A A B)^c
we want to show that (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c, that is

(A A B)^c is a subset of A^C U B^c, and
A^C U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.

Part 1: show that (A A B)^c is a subset of A^C U B^c
by the definition of complement, it is not the case that (x is in both A and B)
so X is not in A or x is not in B -> A^c U B ^c
this also fits morgan's law = (A A B)^c = A^C U B^c

part 2: show that A^c U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.
by the definition of union, x is in A^c or B^c
by the definition of complement, it is not the case that x is in A or it is not the case that x is in B
this is equal to (A A B)^c by morgan's law
therefore A^C U B^c is a subset of (A A B)^c.

therefore the two sets are equal


8. for all sets A and B, (A A B) U (A A B^c) = A
(this property is used in section 9.9)

suppose a and b are any sets, and x E (A A B) U (A A B^c)
we want to show (A A B) U (A A B^c) = A,
that is, we want to show that
1. (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A
2. A is a subset of (A A B) U (A A B^c)

part 1: show that (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A
assume that x is in (A A B) U (A A B^c)
by the definition of union, x is in (A A B) or (A A B^c)
A A B -> by the definition of intersect, x is both in A and B.
(A A B^c) -> by the definition of complement, x is not in B. but its intersect so x is not in B.
so x is in A

therefore, (A A B) U (A A B^c) is a subset of A.

part 2: show that A is a subset of (A A B) U (A A B^c)
assume that x is in A.

case 1: if x E B: then x E A and x E B
so x E A A B

case 2: if x is not an element of B, then x E B^c
since x E A, x E A A B^c

in either case, x E A A B U A A B^c


9. for all sets A,B, and C
(A - B) U (C - B) = (A U C) - B

10. for all sets A,B, and C,
(A U B) A C is a subset of A U (B A C)

11. for all sets A, B, and C,
A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)
