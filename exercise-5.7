ak = 3ak-1 + 2 
a1 = 2 and for every integer k>= 2
a2 = 3a1 + 2 = 3.2 + 2
a3 = 3a2 + 2 = 3.(3.2 + 2) + 2 = (3.3.2) + (3.2) + 2 = (3^2.2) + (3^1.2) + (3^0.2)
a4 = 3a3 + 2 = 3.(3.(3.2 + 2) + 2) + 2 = 3.((3.2) + 2 = (3^2.2) + (3^1.2) + (3^0.2)) + 2 = (3.3^2.2) + (3.3^1.2) + (3.3^0.2) + 2

18. suppose d is a fixed constant and a0, a1, a2, ... is a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation
ak = ak-1 + d for each integer k>=1. use math induction to prove that an = a0 + nd for every itneger n>= 0

answer:
we want to prove that an = a0 + nd is the solution to the recurrence relation ak = ak-1 + d

let p(n) be the following: an = a0 + nd

step 1: show that p(0) is true
p(0) -> a0 = a0 + 0d
RHS = a0 + 0d = a0
LHS = a0
therefore the two sides are equal

step 2: inductive hyphothesis
assume that p(k) if true
p(k) -> ak = a0 + kd

we need to show that p(k+1) is true
ak+1 = a0 + k+1d

ak+1 = ak+1-1 + d
ak+1 = ak + d

since we assumed ak = a0 + kd we can substitute
ak+1 = a0 + kd + d
ak+1 = a0 + d(k+1)

therefore proven

19. a worker is promised a bonus if he can increase his productivity by 2 units a day every day for a period of 30 days
if on day 0 he produces 170 units, how many units must he produce on day 30 to qualify for the bonus?

frequency = 2 units daily
duration = 30 day
d0 = 170 units
d30 = ???

formula guess = [prev accumulated unit] + 2
d1 = 170
d2 = d1 + 2 = (170 + 2)
d3 = d2 + 2 = (170 + 2) + 2
d4 = d3 + 2 = ((170 + 2) + 2) + 2

dk = d0 + 2k
d30 = d0 + 2.30 = 170 + 60 = 230

20. A runner targets herself to improve her time on a 
certain course by 3 seconds a day. If on day 0 she 
runs the course in 3 minutes, how fast must she 
run it on day 14 to stay on target?

answer:
duration: 3s/day
d0 = 3m -> 3.60 = 180s
d1 = 180 - 3
d2 = d1 - 3 = 180 - 3 - 3
d3 = d2 - 3 = 180 - 3 - 3 - 3

dk = d0 - 3k
d14 = 180 - 3.14 = 180 - 42 = 138 = 2 minutes 18 seconds

21. Suppose r is a fixed constant and a0, a1, a2 ... is 
a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation 
ak=rak-1, for each integer k>=1 and a0=a. Use 
mathematical induction to prove that an=ar^n, for 
every integer n>=0.

answer: we want to prove that an=ar^n is the solution to recurrence relation ak = rak-1

let p(n) be the following: an=ar^n
step 1: show that p(0) is true
a0 = ar^0
a0 = a.1
a0 = a -> therefore p(0) is true

step 2: inductive hypothesis
assume that p(k) is true
p(k) -> ak = ar^k

we need to show that p(k+1) is true
p(k+1) -> a(k+1) = ar^k+1

a(k+1) = rak+1-1
a(k+1) = rak

since we assume ak = ar^k in the inductive hypothesis we can substitute
a(k+1) = r . ar^k
a(k+1) = ar^(k+1)

therefore it's proven

22. As shown in Example 5.6.8, if a bank pays interest 
at a rate of i compounded m times a year, then the 
amount of money Pk at the end of k time periods 
(where one time period = 1/mth of a year) satis
fies the recurrence relation Pk = [1 + (i/m)] . Pk-1 
with initial condition P0 = initial amount 
deposited. Find an explicit formula for Pn.

answer:
p0 = initial amount, lets assume it's 10000
and let interest rate i = 4% (0.04), compounded anually
so time period = 0.4/12
p1 = 1 + (0.04/1) . p0 = 1.04 . 10000 = 10400
p2 = 1 + (0.04/1) . p1 = 1.04 . 10400 = 10816

pk = [1 + (i/m)] . pk-1
let R = [1 + (i/m)]
p1 = R . p0
p2 = R . (R . p0-1)
p3 = R . R . (R . p0)

explicit formula guess
pk = r^k . p0
pk = [1 + (i/m)]^k . p0

23. Suppose the population of a country increases 
at a steady rate of 3% per year. If the population 
is 50 million at a certain time, what will it be 
25 years later?

answer:
rate = 0.03
population = 50m
p0 = 50
p1 = 50 + (50 . 0.03) = 51.5
p2 = 51.5 + (51.5 . 0.03) = 51.5+1.545 = 53.045 

we want to find p25
