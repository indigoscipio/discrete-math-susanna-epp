b. if n is an integer and n>=1, find a formula for the expression 5+2+4+6+8...+(2n)
c. if n is an integer and n>=1, find a formula for the expression 3 + 3.2 + 3.3 + ... +3n+n

answer:

ak = 3ak-1 + 2 
a1 = 2 and for every integer k>= 2
a2 = 3a1 + 2 = 3.2 + 2
a3 = 3a2 + 2 = 3.(3.2 + 2) + 2 = (3.3.2) + (3.2) + 2 = (3^2.2) + (3^1.2) + (3^0.2)

highest pwoer -> k-1
lowest power = ^0
ak = 3^0.2 + 3^1.2 + ... + 3^k-1.2

18. suppose d is a fixed constant and a0, a1, a2, ... is a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation
ak = ak-1 + d for each integer k>=1. use math induction to prove that an = a0 + nd for every itneger n>= 0

answer:
we want to prove that an = a0 + nd is the solution to the recurrence relation ak = ak-1 + d

let p(n) be the following: an = a0 + nd

step 1: show that p(0) is true
p(0) -> a0 = a0 + 0d
RHS = a0 + 0d = a0
LHS = a0
therefore the two sides are equal

step 2: inductive hyphothesis
assume that p(k) if true
p(k) -> ak = a0 + kd

we need to show that p(k+1) is true
ak+1 = a0 + k+1d

ak+1 = ak+1-1 + d
ak+1 = ak + d

since we assumed ak = a0 + kd we can substitute
ak+1 = a0 + kd + d
ak+1 = a0 + d(k+1)

therefore proven

19. a worker is promised a bonus if he can increase his productivity by 2 units a day every day for a period of 30 days
if on day 0 he produces 170 units, how many units must he produce on day 30 to qualify for the bonus?

frequency = 2 units daily
duration = 30 day
d0 = 170 units
d30 = ???

formula guess = [prev accumulated unit] + 2
d1 = 170
d2 = d1 + 2 = (170 + 2)
d3 = d2 + 2 = (170 + 2) + 2
d4 = d3 + 2 = ((170 + 2) + 2) + 2

dk = d0 + 2k
d30 = d0 + 2.30 = 170 + 60 = 230

20. A runner targets herself to improve her time on a 
certain course by 3 seconds a day. If on day 0 she 
runs the course in 3 minutes, how fast must she 
run it on day 14 to stay on target?

answer:
duration: 3s/day
d0 = 3m -> 3.60 = 180s
d1 = 180 - 3
d2 = d1 - 3 = 180 - 3 - 3
d3 = d2 - 3 = 180 - 3 - 3 - 3

dk = d0 - 3k
d14 = 180 - 3.14 = 180 - 42 = 138 = 2 minutes 18 seconds

21. Suppose r is a fixed constant and a0, a1, a2 ... is 
a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation 
ak=rak-1, for each integer k>=1 and a0=a. Use 
mathematical induction to prove that an=ar^n, for 
every integer n>=0.

answer: we want to prove that an=ar^n is the solution to recurrence relation ak = rak-1

let p(n) be the following: an=ar^n
step 1: show that p(0) is true
a0 = ar^0
a0 = a.1
a0 = a -> therefore p(0) is true

step 2: inductive hypothesis
assume that p(k) is true
p(k) -> ak = ar^k

we need to show that p(k+1) is true
p(k+1) -> a(k+1) = ar^k+1

a(k+1) = rak+1-1
a(k+1) = rak

since we assume ak = ar^k in the inductive hypothesis we can substitute
a(k+1) = r . ar^k
a(k+1) = ar^(k+1)

therefore it's proven

22. As shown in Example 5.6.8, if a bank pays interest 
at a rate of i compounded m times a year, then the 
amount of money Pk at the end of k time periods 
(where one time period = 1/mth of a year) satis
fies the recurrence relation Pk = [1 + (i/m)] . Pk-1 
with initial condition P0 = initial amount 
deposited. Find an explicit formula for Pn.

answer:
p0 = initial amount, lets assume it's 10000
and let interest rate i = 4% (0.04), compounded anually
so time period = 0.4/12
p1 = 1 + (0.04/1) . p0 = 1.04 . 10000 = 10400
p2 = 1 + (0.04/1) . p1 = 1.04 . 10400 = 10816

pk = [1 + (i/m)] . pk-1
let R = [1 + (i/m)]
p1 = R . p0
p2 = R . (R . p0-1)
p3 = R . R . (R . p0)

explicit formula guess
pk = r^k . p0
pk = [1 + (i/m)]^k . p0

23. Suppose the population of a country increases 
at a steady rate of 3% per year. If the population 
is 50 million at a certain time, what will it be 
25 years later?

answer:
rate = 0.03
population = 50m
p0 = 50
p1 = 50 + (50 . 0.03) = 51.5
p2 = 51.5 + (51.5 . 0.03) = 51.5+1.545 = 53.045 

we want to find p25
recurrence relation & explicit formula guess
pk = p(k-1) + r . p(k-1)  for integer k>=1
pk = p(k-1) (1 + r)

explicit formula guess
we know that if ak = rak-1 then an = a0 . r^n
then we can substitute
pk = 50 . 1.03^k
then p25 = 50 . (1.03)^25
= approx 104.69 million

24. A chain letter works as follows: One person sends 
a copy of the letter to five friends, each of whom 
sends a copy to five friends, each of whom sends 
a copy to five friends, and so forth. How many 
people will have received copies of the letter after 
the twentieth repetition of this process, assuming 
no person receives more than one copy?


r1 = 5 -> one person sends to 5, no person receive more than one copy
r2 = 5 * 5
r3 = (5 * 5) . 5

rk = r^k -> (5^1 + 5^2 + 5^3 ... 5^k)
first term = 5^1
common ratio = 5
number of terms = k
5 (5^20 - 1) / 5 - 1
5 (5^20- 1) / 4

25. A certain computer algorithm executes twice 
as many operations when it is run with an input 
of size k as when it is run with an input of size 
k-1 (where k is an integer that is greater than 1). 
When the algorithm is run with an input of size 1, 
it executes seven operations. How many opera
tions does it execute when it is run with an input 
of size 25?

n1 = 7
n2 = 2.7
n3 = 2.2.7
n4 = 2.2.2.7

we want to find n25
nk = 7 . 2^k-1
n25 = 7 . 2^24 = 7 . 16777216 = 117440512

26. A person saving for retirement makes an initial 
deposit of $1,000 to a bank account earning inter
est at a rate of 3% per year compounded monthly, 
and each month she adds an additional $200 to the 
account.

a. for each nonnegative intger n, let An be the amount in the 
account at the end of n months. find recurrence relation relating 
Ak to Ak-1

answer:
interest = 3% -> 0.03 yearly = 0.0025 per month
compound frequency = monthly
monthly deposit = $200

ak = [total interest acc previously incl deposit] + [interest gained in new preiod]
lets assume  a0 = 1000
ak =  ak-1 * 1.0025 + 200

b. use iteration to find an explicit formula for An

a0 = 1000
a1 = (1000 * 1.0025) + 200
a2 = ((1000 * 1.0025) + 200) . 1.0025 + 200 = (1000 * 1.0025 * 1.0025) + (200 * 1.0025) + 200 = 1000 * 1.0025^2 + 200 * 1.0025^1 + 200
a3 =  (1000 * 1.0025^2 + 200 * 1.0025^1 + 200) * 1.0025 + 200 = (1000 . 1.0025^2 . 1.0025) + (200 . 1.0025 . 1.0025) + (200 . 1.0025) * 1.0025 + 200
= 1000 . 1.0025^3 + 200 . 1.0025^2 + 200 . 1.0025^1 + 200 . 1.0025^0

explicit formula guess
ak = 1000 . (1.0025^0 + 200) . (1.0025^1 + 200) . ... . (1.0025^k + 200)
a = 200
r = 1.0025
n = n1

an = 81000 . 1.0025^n - 80000


C. use mathematical induction to prove correctness of formula in part b

we want to show an = 81000 . 1.0025^n - 80000 is true

step 1: base case: a0
a0 = 81000 . 1.0025^n - 80000 = 81000 - 80000 = 1000 -> true since initial deposit is 1000 we assumed earlier

step 2: inductive hypothesis: assume p(k) is true, then show pk+1 is true
p(k) -> ak = 81000 . 1.0025^k - 80000 is true

show that p(k+1) is true
p(k+1) = ak+1 = 81000 . 1.0025^k+1 - 80000
a(k+1) = ak . 1.0025 + 200

since we assumed ak earlier then we can substitute
a(k+1) = (81000 . 1.0025^k - 80000) . 1.0025 + 200
a(k+1) = 81000 . 1.0025^k+1 - 80200 + 200
a(k+1) = 81000 . 1.0025^k+1 - 80000

therefore proven

e. how many years will the account be worth $10000?
10000 = 81000 . 1.0025^n - 80000
10000 + 80000 = 81000 . 1.0025^n
90000 = 81000 . 1.0025^n
90000/81000 = 1.0025^n
10/9 = 1.0025^n

27. A  person borrows $3,000 on a bank credit card at 
a nominal rate of 18% per year, which is actually 
charged at a rate of 1.5% per month.

a. what is the annual percentage yield (APY) for the card?
initial: 3000

rate: 18% per year = 0.18 per year = 0.015 per month

m1 = 3000 * (1 + 0.015)
m2 = (3000 * (1 + 0.015)) * (1 + 0.015)
m12 = (1 + 0.015)^12 =  1.015^12 = 1.195

APY = 1.195618 - 1 = 19.56%


b. assume that the person does not place any additional charges on the card and pays the bank
$150 each month to pay off the loan. let Bn be the balance owed on the card after n months
find explicit formula for bn

answer:
b1 = (3000 * 1.015) - 150
b2 = (((3000 * 1.015) - 150)) * 1.015) - 150) = 3000 * 1.015 * 1.015 - 150 * 1.015 - 150 = 3000 * 1.015^2 - 150 * 1.015 - 150
b3 = ((3000 * 1.015^2 - 150 * 1.015 - 150)) * 1.015) - 150 = (3000 * 1.015^3) - (150 * 1.015^2) - 150 * 1.015 - 150

bk is a geometric series
first term = 150 . 1.015^0 = 150
ratio = 1.015
terms = k

bk = 10000 - 7000 . 1.015^k

c. how long will be rquired to pay off debt?

0 = 10000 - 7000 . 1.015^n
7000 . 1.015^n = 10000 - 7000 . 1.015^n + 7000 . 1.015^n
7000 . 1.015^n = 10000
1.015^n = 10000/7000
1.015^n = 10/7
1.996 years

d. what is the total amount of money the person will have paid for the loan?
24* 150 = 3600

28. exercise 3

3. ak = k . ak-1 for each integer k>=1
a0 = 1
guess for explicit formula: an = n!

answer:
we want to show that an = n! satisfies recurrence relation ak = k . ak-1

step 1: base case p(0)
a0 = 0!
a0 = 1
threfore the base case a0 is true

step 2: inductive case: assume that p(k) is true
ak = k!

we want to show that p(k+1) is true
we want to show ak+1 = k+1! is true

from the recurrence relation we have
ak+1 = k+1 . ak+1-1
ak+1 = k+1 . ak -> since we assumed that ak = k! we can substitue
ak+1 = k+1 . k! -> from the definition of factorial we can simplify
ak+1 = k+1!
therefore this matches the form of the given explicit formula

29. exercise 4
4. bk = bk-1 / 1 + bk-1 for each integer k>=1
b0 = 1
explicit formula guess:
bn = 1/n+1

answer:
base case p(0)
p0 = 1/0+1 = 1/1 -> base case is true

inductive case: p(k)
assume that p(k) is true, that is
p(k) = 1/k+1 is true

we need to show that p(k+1) is true
p(k+1) = 1/k+1+1 = 1/k+2 is true

from the recurrence relation
p(k+1) = pk+1-1 / 1 + pk+1-1
p(k+1) = pk / 1 + pk

since we assumed that pk = 1/k+1 we can substitute
p(k+1) = 1/k+1 / 1 + 1/k+1

denominator
1 + 1/k+1 = k+1/k+1 + 1/k+1 = 1/k+1

p(k+1) = 1/k+1 / k+2 / k+1
= 1/k+1 * k+1 / k+2
= k+1 / k+1 * k+2
= 1 / k+2

30. exercise 5
5. ck = 3ck-1 + 1 for each integer k>=2
c1 = 1
explicit formula guess cn = 3^n - 1 / 2

step 1: base case p(1)
p1 = 3^1 - 1 / 2 = 3 - 1 / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
therefore the base case p(0) is true

step 2: inductive hypothesis
assume p(k) is true, that is
p(k) = 3^k - 1 / 2 is true

we need to show tkat p(k+1) is true
p(k+1) = 3^k+1 - 1 / 2 is true

from the recurrence relation
p(k+1) = 3pk+1-1 + 1
p(k+1) = 3pk + 1

since we assumed that pk = 3^k - 1 / 2 we can substitute
p(k+1) = 3 (3^k - 1 / 2) + 1
p(k+1) = (3.3^k - 3 / 2) + 1
p(k+1) = 3^k+1 - 3 / 2 + 1
p(k+1) = 3^k+1 - 3 / 2 + 2/2
p(k+1) = 3^k+1 - 1 / 2

31. exercsise 6 
6. dk = 2dk-1 + 3 for each integer k>=2
d1 = 2

explicit formula guess
dn = 5 . 2^n-1 - 3

step1 : base case
p(1) -> 5 . 2^1-1 - 3 = 5 . 2^0 - 3 = 5 . 1 - 3 = 2
therefore the base case p1 is true

step 2 inductive hypotheis
assume p(k) is true, that is
p(k) = 5 . 2^k-1 - 3 is true

we need to show that p(k+1) is true
p(k+1) = 5 . 2^k+1-1 . 3
p(k+1) = 5 . 2^k . 3  is true

from the recurrence relation
p(k+1) = 2pk+1-1 + 3
p(k+1) = 2pk + 3

since we asusmed pk earlier we can substitue
p(k+1) =  2 (5 . 2^k-1 - 3) + 3
p(k+1) = 10 . 2^k-1 - 6 + 3
p(k+1) = 5 . 2^k - 6 + 3
p(k+1) = 5 . 2^k - 3



21. exercise 7
7. ek = 4ek-1 + 5 for each integer k>=1
e0 = 2
explicit formula guess -> en = 4^n . 11 - 5 / 3

step 1: base case p(0)
p0 = 4^0 . 11 - 5 / 3 = 11 - 5 / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2
therefore p0 is true

step 2: asume pk is true
pk = 4^k . 11 - 5 / 3

we need to show pk+1 is true
pk+1 = 4^k+1 . 11 - 5 / 3

from the recurrence relation
pk+1 = 4pk+1-1 + 5
pk+1 = 4pk + 5

since we assumed pk we can substitue
pk+1 = 4 . (4^k . 11 - 5 / 3) + 5
pk+1 = (4 . 4^k . 11) - (4.5) / 3 + 5
pk+1 = (4^k+1 . 11 - 20 / 3) + 5
pk+1 = 4^k+1 . 11 - 20 /3 + 15 / 3
pk+1 = 4^k+1 . 11 - 5 / 3

22. exercise 8

8. fk = fk-1 + 2^k for each integer k>=2
f1 = 1

explicit formula guess
fn = 2^n+1 - 3

answer:
base case p(1) -> 2^2 - 3 = 1
therfore the base case is true

p(k) -> 2^k+1 - 3
assume that pk is true, we need to show that pk+1 is true

we need to show this is true 
pk+1 -> 2^k+2 - 3

from the recurrence relation we know
pk+1 = pk+1-1 + 2^k+1
pk+1 = pk + 2^k+1

since we assumed pk earlier we can substitute
pk+1 = 2^k+1 - 3 + 2^k+1
pk+1 = 2^k+1 + 2^k+1 - 3
pk+1 = 2^k+2 - 3
therefore its proven

34. exercise 9
9. gk = gk-1 / gk-1 + 2 for each integer k>=2
g1 = 1

explicit formula guess
gn = 1 / 2^n - 1

base case p1
g1 = 1 / 2^1 - 1
g1 = 1 / 2 - 1 = 1
therefore base case is true

inductive hypothesis pk
pk = 1 / 2^k - 1

we need to show that pk+1 is true
pk+1 = 1 / 2^k+1 - 1

from therecurrence relation we know
pk = pk-1 / pk-1 + 2 , then
pk+1 = pk+1-1 / pk+1-1 + 2
pk+1 = pk / pk + 2

since we asumed pk earlier we can substitue
pk+1 = 1 / 2^k - 1 / ((1 / 2^k - 1) + 2)
pk+1 = 1 / 2^k - 1 / ((1 / 2^k - 1) + 2.2^k - 1 / 2^k - 1)
pk+1 = 1 / 2^k+1 - 1
therefore it's proven
