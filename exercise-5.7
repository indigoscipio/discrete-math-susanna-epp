Exercise set 5.7
1. the formula 1+2+3+ ...+n = n(n+1)/2
is true for every integer n>=1. use this fact to solve each of the following problems:

a. if k is an integer and k>=2, find a formula for the expression 1+2+3+...+(k-1)
b. if n is an integer and n>=1, find a formula for the expression 5+2+4+6+8...+(2n)
c. if n is an integer and n>=1, find a formula for the expression 3 + 3.2 + 3.3 + ... +3n+n

answer:
a. k-1(k-1+1)/2
= k-1 . k / 2
= k(k-1) / 2
= k^2-k / 2

b. 5 + 2n(2n+1)/2
= 5 + 2 . n(n+1)/2
= 5 + n(n+1)

c. 3 + 3.2 + 3.3 + ... + 3n + n
= 3 (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) + n
= 3 .  n(n+1)/2 + n
= 3n (n+1)/2 + n
= (3n^2 + 3n) / 2 + n
= (3n^2 + 3n) / 2 + 2n/2
= 3n^2 + 5n / 2

2. the formula 1+r+r^2+...+r^n = r^n+1 - 1 / r-1
is true for every real number r except r = 1 and for every integer n>=1
use this fact to solve each of the following problem

a. if i is an integer and i>=1, find a formula for the expression 1+2 + 2^2+... + 2^i-1
b. if n is an integer and n>=1, find a formula for the expression 3^n-1 + 3^n-2+...+3^2+3+1
c. if n is an integer and n>=2, find a formula for the expression 2^n + 2^n-2. 3 + 2^n-3 . 3 + ... + 2^2.3 + 2.3 + 3
d. if n is an integer and n>=1, finda  formula for the expression 2^n - 2^n-1 + 2^n-2 - 2^n-3 + ... + (-1)^n-1 . 2 + (-1)^n

answer:
a. ratio = 2
n = i-1
plug in the formula
2^i-1+1 - 1 / 2-1
= 2^i - 1

b. 3^n-1 + 3^n-2+...+3^2+3+1 -> a reversed version of the example pattern
ratio = 3
n = n-1
plug in the formula
3^n-1+1 - 1 / 3-1
= 3^n - 1 / 2

c. 2^n + 2^n-2. 3 + 2^n-3 . 3 + ... + 2^2.3 + 2.3 + 3
2^n + 3 . (2^n-2 + 2^n-3 + ... + 2^2 + 2 + 1)
= 2^n + 3 . (1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n-3 + 2^n-2)
= 2^n + 3 . 2^n-2+1 - 1 / 2-1
= 2^n + 3 . 2^n-1 - 1
= 2 . 2^n-1 + 3 . 2^n-1  + 3
= 2 + 3 . 2^n-1 - 3
= 5 . 2^n-1 - 3
