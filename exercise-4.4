1. to show a nonzero integer d divides an integer n, we must show that ___
answer: n = d . k where d does not equal to 0 and k is an integer

d | n = 1 | 3
3 = 1 . k where k is an integer and d does not equal to 0

2. to say that d divides n by means the same as saying that ___ is divisble by ___
answer: n is divisibile by d
d | n is equal to  n = d . k
3 | 6 -> 6 is divisibile by 3

3. if a and b are positive integers and a | b, then ____ is less or equal to ____
answer: a <= b

4. for all integers n and d, d does not divide n if, and only if ____
answer: n / d is not an integer
d \| n = 2 |\ 3

5. if a and b are integers, the notation a | b denotes ____ and the notation a / b denotes ___
answer: a divides b, a divided by b (the number)

6. the transitivity of divisibility theorem says that for all integers a, b and c if ___ then ___
answer: a | b and b | c, then a | c

7. the divisibility by a prime theorem says that every integer greater than 1 is ___
answer: divisible by some prime numbers

8. the unique factorization of integer theorem says that any integer greater than 1 is either ___
or can be written as ___ in a way that is unique except possibily for ___ in which the numbers are written
answer: a prime, the product of prime numbers, ordering 

exercise set 4.4
Give a reason for your answer in each of 1â€“13. assume 
that all variables represent integers.

1. is 52 dibisible by 13?
yes because 52 = 13 * 4

2. does 7 | 56
= yes because 56 = 7 * 8

3. does 5 | 0
= yes bceuase 0 = 5 * 0

4. does 3 | (3k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 3)?
= yes, since (3k + 3) = 3(k + 1)
is divisible by 3 then the whole thing is divisibleb y 3

5. is 6m (2m + 10) divisbile by 4?
= 12m^2 + 16m
= 4m(3m + 4)
yes since 4 is a factor of the entire expression

6. is 29 a multiple of 3?
no because 29 isn't divisible by 3

7. is -3 a factor of 66?
yes because -3 . -22 is 66

8. is 6a(a+b) a multiple of 3a?
= 6a^2 + 6ab
= 3a(2a + 2b)
yes because 3a is the factor of the expression above

9. is 4 a factor of 2a . 34b?
= 68ab = 4 (17ab)
yes because 4 is a factor of 68ab

10. does 7 | 34?
= no because 34 cannot be divided by 7
or 34 divided by 7 is not an integer

11. does 13 | 73?
= no because 73 cannot be divided by 13
or 73 divided by 13 is not an integer

12. if n = 4k+1, does 8 divide n^2 -1?
= 8 | (4k+1)^2 - 1
(4k+1) . (4k+1) - 1
8k^2 + 4k + 4k + 1 - 1
= 8k^2 + 8k
= 8k (k + 1)
Since 8k (k + 1) has 8 as a factor, we can conclude that 8 divides (4k^2+1)^2 -1
