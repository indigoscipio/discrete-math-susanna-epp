1. to show a nonzero integer d divides an integer n, we must show that ___
answer: n = d . k where d does not equal to 0 and k is an integer

d | n = 1 | 3
3 = 1 . k where k is an integer and d does not equal to 0

2. to say that d divides n by means the same as saying that ___ is divisble by ___
answer: n is divisibile by d
d | n is equal to  n = d . k
3 | 6 -> 6 is divisibile by 3

3. if a and b are positive integers and a | b, then ____ is less or equal to ____
answer: a <= b

4. for all integers n and d, d does not divide n if, and only if ____
answer: d / n is not an integer
d \| n = 2 |\ 3

5. if a and b are integers, the notation a | b denotes ____ and the notation a / b denotes ___
answer: b = a . k where k is some integer, dividing a by b which may or may not be an integer

6. the transitivity of divisibility theorem says that for all integers a, b and c if ___ then ___
answer: a | b and b | c, then a | c

7. the divisibility by a prime theorem says that every integer greater than 1 is ___
answer: divisible by any prime numbers

8. the unique factorization of integer theorem says that any integer greater than 1 is either ___
or can be written as ___ in a way that is unique except possibily for ___ in which the numbers are written
answer:
