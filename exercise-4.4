exercise set 4.4
Give a reason for your answer in each of 1–13. assume 
that all variables represent integers.

1. is 52 dibisible by 13?
yes because 52 = 13 * 4

2. does 7 | 56
= yes because 56 = 7 * 8

3. does 5 | 0
= yes bceuase 0 = 5 * 0

4. does 3 | (3k + 1)(3k + 2)(3k + 3)?
= yes, since (3k + 3) = 3(k + 1)
is divisible by 3 then the whole thing is divisibleb y 3

5. is 6m (2m + 10) divisbile by 4?
= 12m^2 + 16m
= 4m(3m + 4)
yes since 4 is a factor of the entire expression

6. is 29 a multiple of 3?
no because 29 isn't divisible by 3

7. is -3 a factor of 66?
yes because -3 . -22 is 66

8. is 6a(a+b) a multiple of 3a?
= 6a^2 + 6ab
= 3a(2a + 2b)
yes because 3a is the factor of the expression above

9. is 4 a factor of 2a . 34b?
= 68ab = 4 (17ab)
yes because 4 is a factor of 68ab

10. does 7 | 34?
= no because 34 cannot be divided by 7
or 34 divided by 7 is not an integer

11. does 13 | 73?
= no because 73 cannot be divided by 13
or 73 divided by 13 is not an integer

12. if n = 4k+1, does 8 divide n^2 -1?
= 8 | (4k+1)^2 - 1
(4k+1) . (4k+1) - 1
8k^2 + 4k + 4k + 1 - 1
= 8k^2 + 8k
= 8k (k + 1)
Since 8k (k + 1) has 8 as a factor, we can conclude that 8 divides (4k^2+1)^2 -1

13. if n = 4k + 3, does 8 divide n^2 - 1 ?
(4k+3)^2 - 1
= (4k+3) (4k+3) - 1
= 16k^2 + 12k + 12k + 9 - 1
= 16k^2 + 24k + 8
= 8 (2k^2 + 3k + 1)
since 8k (2k + 4) has 8 as a factor we can cunclude 8 divides (4k+3)^2 - 1

14. Fill in the blanks in the following proof that for all 
integers a and b, if a | b then a | (-b).

proof:  Suppose a and b are any integers such that  (a).
By definition of divisibility, there exists an integer r such that (b) . By substitution,

-b = -(ar) = a(-r)
let t = (c). Then t is an integer because = (-1)r, and both -1 and r are integers.
Thus, by substitution, -b = at, where t is an integer, and 
so by definition of divisibility, (d), as was to be shown.

answer:
a. a divides b
b. b = a . r where r is an integer
c. -r
d. a divides -b

prove statements 15 and 16 directly from the definition 
of divisibility.
15. for all integers a,b, and c, if a | b and a | c then a | (b + c)
Suppose a b and c is any integer [we must show that if a | b and a | c then a | (b + c)]

a | b -> By definition of divisibility, there exists an integer r such that b = a . r
a | c -> By definition of divisibility, there exists an integer s such that c = a . s
Then we can substitute

a | (b + c)
b + c = (a . r) + (a . s)
b + c = a (r + s)

let t = (r+s), since integer plus integer therefore t is an integer
Since a is mulitplied by an integer, this means that a is a factor of b + c [as was to be shown]


16. for all integers a,b,and c if a | b then a | c then a | (b-c)
suppose a b and c are any particular integer [we must show that if a | b then a | c then a | (b-c)]

a | b -> by the definition of divisibility, there exists an integer r such that b = a . r
a | c -> by the definition of divisibility, there exists an integer s such that c = a . s


a | (b - c)
b - c = (a . r) - (a . s)
b - c = a (r - s)

let t = (r-s). since integer minus integer is an integer, t is an integer
Since a is multiplied by an integer, this means that a is a factor of (b - c) [as was to be shown]

17. for all integers a, b, and c and d if a | c and b | d then ab | cd
suppose a b c d is any particular integer [we must show that if a | c and b | d then a b | c d]

a | c -> by the definition of divisibility, there exists an integer r such that c = a . r
b | d -> by the definition of divisibility, there exists an integer s such that d = b . s

Then we can substitute
a b | c d
cd = (a . r) (b . s)
cd = (ab) . (rs)

let t = rs. since product of integers are integrs therefore t is an integer
Since ab is multiplied by integer this means ab is a factor of cd. [as to be shown]

18.Consider the following statement: The negative of any multiple of 3 is a multiple of 3.
a. Write the statement formally using a quantifier and a variable.
answer: Ax integer a, if a is a multiple of 3, then -a is also a multiple of 3

b. Determine whether the statement is true or false and justify your answer.
let n = 3k for some integer k
then -n = -3k is still a multiple of 3 because it can be writen as 3(-k) where -k is still an integer
therefore the statement is true

19. Show that the following statement is false: For all integers a and b, if 3 | (a + b) then 3 | (a - b).
Ax integer a and b, if 3 | (a + b) -> 3 | (a - b)

Suppose a and b is any particular integer [we must show that if 3 | (a + b) then 3 | (a - b). ]

let a = 1, b = 2
3 | (a + b) -> 3 | 3 (true)
3 | (a - b) -> 3 | -1 (false)
Since we found a counterexample wehere the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the statement above is false.

For each statement in 20–32, determine whether the 
statement is true or false. prove the statement directly 
from the definitions if it is true, and give a counterex
ample if it is false.
20. the sum of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 3
s = a + a + 1 + a + 2
s = 3a + 3
= 3 (a + 1)
This is clearly divisible by 3 since 3 is a factor of the sum of three consecutive integer [as was to be shown]

21. the product of any two even integers is a multiple of 4
by the definition of even itneger, an integer is even if it can be written as 2k where k is an integer

p = (2k) . (2n)
p = 4kn
p = 4 (kn)
let t = kn. since product of integer is an integer, therefore t is an integer
since 4 is a factor of two product of even integer, thereforew the product of any two integer is a multiple of 4

22. it A necessary condition for an integer to be divisible by 6 is that it be divisible by 2
P is necessary for Q = ~P -> ~Q or Q -> P
Ax integer n, if n is divisible by 6, then n is divisible by 2

if an integer is divibile by 6 that means n = 6k for some integer k
if an integer is divisible by 2, that means n = 2k for some integer m

6k can be written as 2(3k) with 2 as the factor and therefore is divisible by 2
therefore if an itneger is divisible by 6, it is also dvisible by 2 [as was to be shown]. So the statmeent is true

23. A sufficient condition for an integer to be divisible by 8 is that it be divisible by 16.
p is sufficient of q = p -> q
Ax integer n, if n is divisible by 16, it's divisible by 8

If an integer is divisible by 16, that means n = 16k for some integer k
if an integer is divisible by 8, that means n = 8k for some integer m

Then we can substitute
16k = 8(2k) where 2k is some integer
Therefore 8 is the factor of 16k, and 16k is divisible by 8 [as was to be shown]

24. for all integers a,b,and c if a | b and a | c then a | (2b-3c)
Suppose a b and c is any ingeger [we must show that  if a | b and a | c then a | (2b-3c)]

By the definition of divisibility, a | b can be written as b = a . r where r is some integer
By the definition of divisibility, a | c can be written as c = a . s where s is some integer
Then we can substitute

2b - 3c = 2 (ar) - 3 (as)
= 2ar - 3as
= a (2r - 3s)

Let t = (2r - 3s). Since any integer minus any integer is an integer, threfore t is an intger
Since a is a factor of (2r - 3s), therefore a | (2b-3c) is true since a is also a factor of (2b - 3c)

25. for all integers a,b, andc, if a is a factor of c and b is a factor of c, then ab is a factor of c
suppose a b and c is any prticular integer [we must show that if a is a factor of c and b is a factor of c, then ab is a factor of c]

Coutnerexample
let a = 4, b = 6 and c = 12
a | c because 12 = 4 x 3
b | c = 12 = 6 x 2
but ab = 4 x 6 = 24, whch does not divide 12

Therefore the statement is false since we found a counterexmaple

26. for all integers a,b,and c, if ab | c then a|c and b|c
suppose a b c is any integer [we must show that if ab | c then a|c and b|c]

By the definition of divisibility, ab | c can be written as c = ab . r where r is some integer
By the definition of divisibility, a | c can be written as c = a . s where s is some integer

First prove a | c
c = ab . r
= a (b . r)

Prove b| c
c = ab . r
= b (a . r)

Since both parts are proven therefore the statement is true

27. For all integers a,b,and c, if a | (b+c) then a | b or a | c

a | b + c
b + c = a . k for some integer k

let a = 3, b =2 , c =1
a | (b + c)?
3 | 3? True

a | b? 3 | 2 (false)
a | c? 3 | 1 (false)
Threfore false since the counterexmample is found

28. For all integers a,b,and c if a | bc then a | b or a | c
By the definition of divisibility, a | bc can be written as bc = a . r where r is some integer

let a = 1, b=2, c=3
a | bc?
does 1 divide 6? yes

a | b
1 | 2 ? yes

a | c
a | 3? yes

let a = 6, b=2, c=3
6 | 6? true
6 | 2? false
6 | 3? false
Therefore the counterexample is found . The statement is false


29. For all integers a and b, if a | b then a^2  | b^2
By the definition of divisibility, a | b can be written as b = a . r where r is some integer

Then we can substitute
b^2
= (a . r)^2
= a^2 . r^2

let t = r^2. Since integer power is integer therefore t is an integer
then by a^2 is the factor of (a . r)^2. Therefore the statement is true

30. For all integers a and n, if a | n^2 and a <=n then a | n
let a = 4 and n = 6
4 | 36
4 <= 6


31.. for all integers a and b, if a | 10b then a | 10 or a | b
let a = 6, b = 3
6 | 30 -> true
6 | 10 (false)
6 | 3 (false)
therefore the satement is false by counterexample

32. A fast-food chain has a contest in which a card with 
numbers on it is given to each customer who makes 
a purchase. If some of the numbers on the card add 
up to 100, then the customer wins $100. A certain 
customer receives a card containing the numbers
 72, 21, 15, 36, 69, 81, 9, 27, 42, and 63.
 Will the customer win $100? Why or why not?

 No because all of the numbers above are divisible by 3 (3 is a factor of those numbers)
 since 100 is not divisible by 3, then the customer cannot win.

 33. Is it possible to have a combination of nickels, dimes and quarters that add up to $4.72?
explain. Let the following
 nickel = 0.05
 dime = 0.10
 quarter = 0.25

 No, because we only can use the following
8 quarters -> $4
7 dimes -> $0.70
and if we add even 1 nickel -> $0.05
All of these variables are divisible by 5.
Since all coins involved (nickels, dimes, and quarters) are multiples of 5 cents, any total amount must be a multiple of 0.05.
But 4.72 is not a multiple of 0.05 (since 472 ÷ 5 is not an integer).
Total = $4.75 so it exceeds the given number. But its psosible with penny

34. Consider a string consisting of a’s, b’s, and c’s 
where the number of b’s is three times the num
ber of a’s and the number of c’s is five times the 
number of a’s. Prove that the length of the string is 
divisible by 3.

b = 3a
c = 5a

Total length of string = a + b + c
does 3 divide a + b + c ?

Then we can substitute -> a + 3a + 5a
= 9a
= 3 (3a)

let t = 3a, since integer times integer is an integer therefore t is an itneger
Then by the definition of divisibility, 3 is a factor of some integer t. Theefore it is divisible by 3 [as to be shown]

35. Two athletes run a circular track at a steady 
pace so that the first completes one round in 8 
minutes and the second in 10 minutes. If they 
both start from the same spot at 4 p.m., when 
will be the first time they return to the start 
together?

athlete 1 = 8m
athlete 2 = 10m

Find the least common multipel = 40 minutes
so they will meet at the start at 4pm + 40 minutes = 4:40 PM

= 2^15 x 3^ 20 . 13^5

c. is n^5 divisibile by 20? explain
20 = 2^2 . 5
Since n^5 does not have a factor of  5, then it cannot be divided by 20.

b. find the least positive integer k such that 2^4 . 3^5 . 7 . 11^2 . k is a perfect cube
(that is it equals an integers to the third power)
Write the resulting product as a perfect cube
answer: each factors exponent must be divisible by 3 so
2^4 -> we need 2^2, so 2 . 2
3^5 -> we need 3^1 so just 3
7^1 -> we need 7^2 so 7 . 7
11^2 -> we need 11^1 so 11

therefore k = 2 . 2 . 3 . 7 . 7 . 11 = 6468

a. if a and b are integers and 12a = 25b, does 12 | b ?
does 25 | a ? explain

b = 12a / 25
First question, does  12 | b ?
= no, 12 does not divide b unless a is a multiple of 25

does 25 | a?
= No, 25 does not divide a unless b is a multiple of 12


b. if x and y are integers and 10x = 9y, does 10 | y? does 9 | x?
explain

x = 9y/10
y = 10x/9

First, does 10 | y ?
For 10 to divide y, y must be an integer
We see that y = 10x / 9 which is no an integer unless x is 9
Therefore its false

Second, does 9 | x ?
For 9 to divide x, x must be an integer
We see that x = 9y / 10 which is no an integer unless y is 10
Therefore its false
