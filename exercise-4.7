1. to prove a statement by contradiction, you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: the statement is false and you show that the supposition leads to a contradiction

2. a proof by contraposition of a statement of the form
answer: Ax E D, if P(x) then Q(x) is a direct proof of Ax E D, if ~Q(x) then ~P(x)

3. to prove a statement of the form Ax E D, if P(x) then Q(x),
by contraposition, you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: x is any [particular but arbirarily chosen element] of D for which ~Q(x) is true, ~P(x) is true

Exercise set 4.7
1. fill in the blank in the following proof by contracdiction that the


 Proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive real number x.
 [We must deduce (a)]
 
Consider the number x/2. Since x is a positive real number, x/2 is also (b).
In addition, we can deduce that x/2 < x by multiplying both sides of the inequality 1 < 2 by 
(c) and dividing (d). Hence x/2 is a positive real number that is less than the least positive real number. 
This is a (e) . [Thus the supposition is false, and so there is no least positive real number.]

answer:
a) a contradiction
b) x
c) 2
d) x
e) contradiction

2. is 1/0 an irrational number? explain
1/0 is not an irrational number because any number dividede by 0 is undefined.
by the definition of irrational number, a number is irrational if it cannot be expressed as ratio of two intergers

3. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is not divisible by 3

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is divisible by 3. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

Since 3n + 2 divisible by 3, we can write it as the following
a = 3
b = 3n + 2
3 | 3n + 2

3n + 2 = 3r 
2 = 3r - 3n
2 = 3(r - n)
let k = (r - n), since integer minus integer is integer, k is an integer
so 2 = 3 . k -> 3 | 2. By the definition of divisibility, 3 does not divide 2 perfect.ly
The contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false, and so 3 does not divide 3n+2]

4. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer m, 7m + 4 is not divisible by 7

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 7m + 4 is divisible by 7. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

a = 7
b = 7m + 4
7 | 7m+4

7m+4 = 7r
4 = 7r - 7m
4 = 7 (r - m)
let k = (r - m), since integer minus integer is an integer therefore k is an integer

so 4 = 7k. -> 7 | 4. By the definition of divisibility, 7 does not divide 4 perfectly.
the contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false and so 7 does not divide 7m + 4]


 Carefully formulate the negations of each of the state
ments in 5â€“7. then prove each statement by contradiction
