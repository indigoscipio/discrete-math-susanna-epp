Exercise set 4.7
1. fill in the blank in the following proof by contracdiction that the


 Proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive real number x.
 [We must deduce (a)]
 
Consider the number x/2. Since x is a positive real number, x/2 is also (b).
In addition, we can deduce that x/2 < x by multiplying both sides of the inequality 1 < 2 by 
(c) and dividing (d). Hence x/2 is a positive real number that is less than the least positive real number. 
This is a (e) . [Thus the supposition is false, and so there is no least positive real number.]

answer:
a) a contradiction
b) x
c) 2
d) x
e) contradiction

2. is 1/0 an irrational number? explain
1/0 is not an irrational number because any number dividede by 0 is undefined.
by the definition of irrational number, a number is irrational if it cannot be expressed as ratio of two intergers

3. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is not divisible by 3

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is divisible by 3. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

Since 3n + 2 divisible by 3, we can write it as the following
a = 3
b = 3n + 2
3 | 3n + 2

3n + 2 = 3r 
2 = 3r - 3n
2 = 3(r - n)
let k = (r - n), since integer minus integer is integer, k is an integer
so 2 = 3 . k -> 3 | 2. By the definition of divisibility, 3 does not divide 2 perfect.ly
The contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false, and so 3 does not divide 3n+2]

4. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer m, 7m + 4 is not divisible by 7

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 7m + 4 is divisible by 7. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

a = 7
b = 7m + 4
7 | 7m+4

7m+4 = 7r
4 = 7r - 7m
4 = 7 (r - m)
let k = (r - m), since integer minus integer is an integer therefore k is an integer

so 4 = 7k. -> 7 | 4. By the definition of divisibility, 7 does not divide 4 perfectly.
the contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false and so 7 does not divide 7m + 4]


 Carefully formulate the negations of each of the state
ments in 5–7. then prove each statement by contradiction
5. there is no greatest even integer
a. statement negation
Ax integer n, if n is even, then Ex integer m, with m even and m > n
negation: Ex integer n such that for all even integers m, m <= n

b. prove by contradiction

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a greatest even integer.
[we must deduce a contradiction]

By the definition of even, a number is even if it can be written as n = 2k for some integer k

N <= N + 2
N + 2 is even because even + even = even
N + 2 is bigger than N

but N was supposed to be the greatest even integer and now n + 2 is bigger than N
this is a contradiction. [thus the suposition is false and so there is a greatest even integer is false]

6. there is no greatest negative real number
a. negation: there is a greatest negative real number

b. prove by contradiction
proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a greatest negative real number
[we must deduce a contradiction]

let N = greatest negative real number

N/2 <= N
since n/2 is negative n/2 is bigger than N which is closer to 0.
but we assume N to be the greatest negative real number which is false
therefore its a contradiction. [thus the suposition is false and so there is a greatest negative real number is false]

7. there is no least positive rational number
a. negation: there is a least positive rational number

b. proof:
proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive rational number
[we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of rational number a number is rational if it can be written as r = n / k where k is an integer and does not equal 

let N = least positive rational number
N > N/2

n/2 is a rational number because n is an integer and 2 does not equal 0
if n is positive then n/2 is also positive

we assume N to be the least positive real number but n/2 is smaller actually than N
this is a contradiction [thus the supposition is false and so there is a least positive rational number is false]

8. fill in the blanks for the following proof that thedifference of any rational number and
any rational number is irrational

Proof (by contradiction): Suppose not. That is, suppose that there exist (a) x and  (b) y such that x - y is rational.
By definition of rational, there exist integers a, b, c, and d with b does not equal 0 and d does not equal 0 so that
x = (c) and x - y = (d)

By substitution,


a / b - y = c/d

Adding y and subtracting c/d on both sides gives

y = (e) (by substitution)
= ad / bd - bc / bd
= ad - bc / bd (by algebra)

Now both ad-bc and bd are integers because products and differences of 
(f) are (g). and bd does not equal 0 by the (h). Hence y is a ratio of integers
with a nonzero denominator, and thus y is (i) by definition of rational.

We therefore have both that y is irrational and that y is rational, which is a 
contradiction. [Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.]

a) a rational number x
b) irrational number y
c) a/b
d) c/d
e) a/b - c/d
f) integers
g) integers
h) definition of rational number
i) rational

9. a.  When asked to prove that the difference of any 
irrational number and any rational number is 
irrational, a student began, “Suppose not. That 
is, suppose the difference of any irrational 
number and any rational number is rational.”
 What is wrong with beginning the proof in 
this way? (Hint: If needed, review the answer 
to exercise 11 in Section 3.2.)

answer: the student incorrectly negates the original statement
the correct version is this: Suppose not. that is, suppose the difference of some irrational number and some rational number is rational

b. prove that the differenec of any irrational number and any rational number is irrational
proof: Suppose not. that is, suppose the difference of some irrational number and some rational number is rational
[we must deduce a contradiction]

let r = some rational number
let i = some irrational number

we must prove that i - r = q where q is some rational number
by the definition of rational number, a rational can be written as fraction a/b where a is an integer and b does not equal 0
then we can substitute the definition

i - a/b = c/d
i = a/b + c/d
i = ad + cb / bd
ad + cb is an integer because sum of product of integer is anteger and bd is nonzero
therefore ad + cb / bd is a rational number and i is a rational number. But this contradicts with our assumption that i is irrational.
And i cannot be both rational and irrational. This is a contradiction. [Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.] 


10. let S be the statement: for all positive real numbers r and s, sqrt(r+s) does not equal sqrt(r) + sqrt(s).
Statement S is true but the following "proof" is incorrect. Find the mistake

Proof by contradiction: suppose not. that is, suppose that for all positive real nubers r and s,
sqrt(r+s) equals sqrt(r) + sqrt(s).

This means that the equation will be true no matter what positive real numbers 
are substituted for r and s. So let r = 0 and s = 16. Then r and s are positive real numbers and

sqrt(r+s) = sqrt(9+16) = sqrt(25) = 5

whereas sqrt(r) + sqrt(s) = sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 3 + 4 = 7

since 5 does not equal 7, we have that sqrt(r+s) does not equal sqrt(r) + sqrt(s)
which contradicts the supposition that sqrt(r+s) = sqrt(r) + sqrt(s). this contradiction shows that the supposition is flase
and hence the statement S is true

answer: 
mistakenly negate the original statmeent - negation of For All should be There exists some, so it should be 
For some positive real numbers r and s, sqrt(r+s) equals sqrt(r) + sqrt(s)

11. Let T be the statement: The sum of any two rational numbers is rational.
Then T is true, but the following “proof” is incorrect. Find the mistake.

 “Proof by contradiction: Suppose not. That is, suppose that the sum of any two rational numbers 
is not rational. This means that no matter what two rational numbers are chosen their sum is not rational.

Now both 1 and 3 are rational because 1 = 1/1 and 3 = 3/1, and so both are ratios of 
integers with a nonzero denominator.

Hence, by a supposition, the sum of 1 and 3, which is 4, is not rational.
But 4 is rational because 4 = 4/1, which is a ratio of integers with a nonzero denominator. 

Hence 4 is both rational and not rational, which is a contradiction.
This contradiction shows that the supposition is false, and hence statement T is true.”

answer: the mistake was in the negation. suppose that the sum of any two rational numbers 
is not rational is incorrect. the correct version should be "suppose that there eixts two rational numbers whose sum is not rational"

12. let R be the statement: the square root of any irrational nubmer is irrational
a. write negation for R
Ax number i, if i is irrational, sqrt(i) is irrational
negation: Ex number i, i is irrational and sqrt(i) rational
negation: There exists an irrational number whose square root is rational

b. prove R by contradiction
Suppose not. That is, suppose that there exists an irrational number whose square root is rational
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

 i = irrational
sqrt(i) = rational

by the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as
a / b where a and b is integer and b does not equal 0

then we can substitute
sqrt(i) = q where q is a rational number

sqrt(i) = a/b
square the two sides
i = a^2 / b^2
a^2 and b^2 is an integer because square of integer is an integer, and we know b^2 is nonzero
thus this fits the definition of a rational number above. But this is a contradiction because in the beginning we suppose i to be irrational
and i is both rational and irrational. [Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.] 


13. let S be the statement: the product of any irrational number and any nonzero rational number is irrational
a. write a negation for S
Ax irrational number i, Ax rational number r, if r does not equal 0, then i . r = irrational
negation: Ex irrational number i, Ex rational number r, r does not equal 0 and i . r = rational
negation: The product of some irrational number and some nonzero rational number is rational

b. prove S by contradiction
Suppose not. That is, suppose that The product of some irrational number and some nonzero rational number is rational
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

by the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b is integers and be does not equal 0

irratioal number = i
rational number = r where r does not equal 0
let i . r = q where q is a rational number

from here we can substitute
i = q / r
i = a/b / c/d
i = a/b . d/c
i = ac . bd / bc

ac . bd is an integer because the product of integers are integers, and bc is nonzero
This fits the definition of a rational number. However this is a contradiction because we assumed that i = irrational but we get a rational number as an answer
[Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.] 


14. let T be the statement: for every integer a, if a mod 6 = 3 then a mod 3 does not equal 2
a. write negation for t
Ax integer a, if a mod 6 = 3, then a mod 3 does not equal 2
Ex integer a, a mod 6 = 3 and a mod 3 does not equal 2
negation: There exists an integer a where a mod 6 = 3 and a mod 3 = 2

b. prove T by contradiction
Suppose not. That is, suppose that There exists an integer a where a mod 6 = 3 and a mod 3 = 2
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

By the quotient reminder theorem, a mod 6 = 6 . q + r where q is an integer and 0 <= r < 6
since a mod 6 = 3, the reminder r = 3, thus a = 6q + 3

a mod 6 = 3
a mod 3 = 2

a mod 3 = 6q + 3 mod 3

6q is divisible by 3 -> r = 0
3 is divisiblle by 3 also, so 6q + 3 leaves 0 reminder -> 3 | 6q + 3
6q mod 3 + 3 mod 3 = 0 + 0
0 mod 3 = 0

But our initial supposittion was a mod 3 = 2 but we found out that 0 mod 3 = 0 which is a contradiciton.
[Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.] 


15. do there exist integeres a, b, and c such that a, b, and c are all odd and a^2 + b^2 = c^2?
Prove your answer

let a = 1
let b = 1
let c = 1

1 + 1 = 1 -> false

generalized proof
a = 2x + 1
b = 2y + 1
c = 2z + 1

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

(2x + 1)^2 + (2y + 1)^2 = (2z + 1)^2
(2x+1) . (2x+1) + (2y+1) . (2y+1) = (2z+1) . (2z+1)
(4x^2 + 2x + 2x + 1) + (4y^2 + 2y + 2y + 1) = (4z^2 + 2z + 2z + 1)
(4x^2 + 4x + 1) + (4y^2 + 4y + 1) = (4z^2 + 4z + 1)
4x^2 + 4x + 4y^2 + 4y + 2 = 4z^2 + 4z + 1
4(x^2 + x + y^2 + y) + 2 = 4 (z^2 + z) + 1

let k = (x^2 + x + y^2 + y), m = (z^2 + z) + 1
left side (4k + 2) : reminder is 2
right side (4k + 1): reminder is 1

therefore we found a contradiction. A integer cannot have 2 different reminder when divided by 4. [and so the statement is false]

prove each statement in 16 - 19 by contradiction
16. for all integers a and b, b^2 - a^2 does not equal 4
(hint: b^2 - a^2 = (b + a) (b - a)) and the only way to factor 4 is eiter 4 = 2.2 or 4 = 4 . 1
Ax integers a anb b, b^2 - a^2 does not equal 4
negation: Ex integer a and b, b^2 - a^2 equals 4
negation: There exists some integer a and b where b^2 - a^2 = 4

Suppose not. That is, suppose that There exists some integer a and b where b^2 - a^2 = 4
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

4 = (b + a) - (b - a)
let x = b + a, y = b - a

b + a
if one is odd and the other is even: parity is odd
if both is odd, parity is even
if both is even, parity is even

b - a
if one is odd and the other is even: parity is odd
if both is odd, parity is even
if both is even, parity is even

therefore must have the same parity and are either both even or odd
this means the pair of integers b + a, b - a must be one of the pairs of integers factors whose product is 4

this leaves only  2, 2 and -2, -2 since they have the same parity

case 1: Suppose b+a=2 AND b−a=2.
(b+a) - (b−a)=2 - 2
2a = 0
a = 0/2 = 0

case 2: Suppose b+a=−2 AND b−a=−2.
(b+a)+(b−a)= −2+(−2)
2b = -4
b = -2

b^2 - a^2 = 4
-2^2 - 0^2 = 4

[this contradicts the supposition]

17. for all prime number a, b, and c, a^2 + b^2 does not equal c^2
negation: for some prime number a,b,and c, a^2 + b^2 = c^2

proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that for some prime number a,b,and c, a^2 + b^2 = c^2
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

case 1: a,b,anc c are all odd primes
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
odd + odd = odd
even = odd
this is a contradiction since integer cannot be both even or odd

case 2: one of the 3 is number 2, and the other 2 is odd
2^2 + b^2 = c^2
4 + b^2 = c^2
4 = c^2 - b^2
4 = (c - b) (c + b)
4 = even . even
4 = even

probability 2a: c - b = 2 and c + b =2
4 = (c - b)  + (c + b)
4 = 2c
2 = c

4 = (c - b)  - (c + b)
b = 0

probability 2b: c - b = -2 and c + b = 2
4 = (c - b) + (c + b)
4 = 2c
2 = c

4 = (c - b) - (c + b)
b = 0

c and b both are not odd primes therefore its acontradiction


case 3: both a and b are prime 2
2^2 + 2^2 = c
8 = c^2
there is no prime number c such that c^2 = 8


18. if a and b are rational numbers, b does not equal 0, and r is an irrational number, then a + br is irrational
Ax rational number a and b, if b does not equal 0 and r is an irrational number, then a + br is irrational
negation: Ex rational number a and b, b does not equal 0 and r is an irrational number and a + br is rational
negation: there exists numbers a and b whre b does not equal 0 and r is an irrational number and a + br is rational

proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that there exists numbers a and b whre b does not equal 0 and r is an irrational number and a + br is rational
[we must deduce  a contradiction]
by the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b is integer and b does not equal 0

r = irrational number
a and b = rational number

a + br = q where q is rational number
q - a = b
q-a/b = r

q-a/b is rational because q-a is rational - rational is rational
and b is rational because b does not equal 0

therefore we found a contradiction where q-a/b is rational whereas in our initial supposition we suppost it to be irrational
but itcannot be both.

19. for any integer n, n^2 - 2 is not divisible by 4
negation: For some integer n, n^2-2 is divisible by 4


proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that For some integer n, n^2-2 is divisible by 4
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

n^2 - 2 is divisible by 4
this means 4 | n^2 - 2

n^2 - 2 = 4 . q where q is an integer
n^2 = 4q + 2

4q + 2 mod 4 = 2
since n is any integer we need to divide into 2 cases

case 1: n is even (n = 2k)
2k^2 = 2k . 2k = 4k^2
n^2 mod 4 = 0


case 2: n is odd
2k+1^2 = 4q + 2
n^2 =  4k^2 + 4k + 1
n^2 mod 4 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 mod 4
1 mod 4 = 1

thus we found the contradiction becasue n^2 mod 4 cannot both be 0 and 1

20. fill in the blanks in the following proof by contraposition that for every integer n,
if 5 does not divide n^2 then 5 does not divide n

Proof (by contraposition)
[the contrapositive is: for every integer n, if 5 | n then 5 | n^2]
suppose n is any integer such that (a). [we must show that (b)]

by the definition of divisibility, n = (c) for some iteger k
by substitution, n^2 = (d) = 5 (5k^2)

But 5k^2 is an integer because it is a product of integers
hence n^2 = 5 . (an integer), and so (e) [as was to be shown]

a) 5 | n
b) 5 | n^2
c) 5k
d) 5k^2
e) 5 | n^2

21. consider the statement "for every integer n, if n^2 is odd then n is odd"
a. Write what you would suppose and what you would need to show to prove this statement by contradiction.
negation: for some integer n, n^2 is odd and n is even

proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that for some integer n, n^2 is odd and n is even
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

n^2 = 4k^2
2. (2 . k^2)
therefore it has even parity and we found the contradiction

b. Write what you would suppose and what you would need to show to prove this statement by contraposition.
proof by contraposition
Contrapositiev: for every integer n, if n is even then n^2 is even

suppose n is any integer [we must show that if n is even then n^2 is even]

n^2 = 2k^2 = 2k . 2k
n^2 = 4k^2

we must show that n^2 is even
4k^2 = 2 . (2 . k^2)

by the definition of even number, n^2 follows the form 2 (some integer)
therefore the contrapositive is proven [QED]

22. consider the statement "for every real number r, if r^2 is irrational then r is irrational"
a. Write what you would suppose and what you would need to show to prove this statement by contradiction.
negation: For some real number r, r^2 is irrational and r is rational

proof by contradiction:
proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that for some real number r, r^2 is irrational and r is rational
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

we must show that r is irrational
by the definition of rational number, r = a/b where a and b are both integers and b does not equal 0
r = a/b

r^2 = (a/b)^2
= a^2 / b^2

we know that a^2 is an integer and b^2 is also an integer. b^2 is nonzero and therefore fits the definition of rational number
but this is a contradiction because we supposed r^2 to be an irrational number [therefore the contradiction was proven]


b. Write what you would suppose and what you would need to show to prove this statement by contraposition.
contrapositive: for every real number r, if r is rational then r^2 is rational
proof by contrapositive
suppose that r is a real number. [we must show that if r is rational then r^2 is rational]

by the definition of rational number, r = a/b where a and b is integer and b does not equal 0

then we can substitute
r^2 = (a/b)^2
= a^2/b^2

a^2 is n integer because product of integer is integer and b^2 is also integer and its nonzero
therefore this follows the definition of a rational nu

prove each of the statements in 23–25 in two ways:  
(a) by contraposition and (b) by contradiction.

23. The negative of any irrational number is irrational.
proof by contraposition:
Ax number n, if n is irrational, -n is irrational 
contrapositive: Ax number n, if -n is rational, then n is rational
For all number n, if -n is rational, then n is rational

by the definition of rational number , n = a/b where a and b are both integer and b does not equal 0
now lets try -n (apply negative)

-n = -(a/b)
= -a / b
-a is an integer and -b is an integer and b is nonzero
therefore the form follows the definition of rational number [proof by contrapositive is done]


prof by contradiction:
Ax number n, if n is irrational, -n is irrational 
negation:  Ex number n, n is irrational and -n is rational
by the definition of rational number , n = a/b where a and b are both integer and b does not equal 0

[we must show -n is irrational]

n = a/b
-n = -a / b
-a and b is an integer and b is nonzero and therefore follows the form of the definition of rational number
but we suppose n to be irrational and n cannot be both irrational and rational [the supposition is false and contradiction is proven]


24. The reciprocal of any irrational number is irrational. (The reciprocal of a nonzero real number x is 1/x.)
proof by contrapositive:
Ax number n, if n is irrational, then 1/n is irrational
contrapositive: Ax number n, if 1/n is rational, then n is rational
For all number n, if 1/n is rational, then n is rational

suppose for all number n, 1/n is rational [we must show n is rational]

by the definition of rational number , n = a/b where a and b are both integer and b does not equal 0

1/n = 1/a/b = b/a
b is an integer and a is an integer and a is nonzero
therefore this fits with thedefinition of rational number [contraposition proven]

proof by contradiction:
Ax number n, if n is irrational, then 1/n is irrational
negation: Ex number n, n is irrational and 1/n is rational
There exists a number n such that n is irrational and 1/n is rational

Suppose not. That is, suppose that There exists a number n such that n is irrational and 1/n is rational
[we must prove a contradiction]

by the definition of rational number , n = a/b where a and b are both integer and b does not equal 0

1/n = 1/a/b = b/a
b is an integer and a is an integer and a is nonzero
therefore this fits with thedefinition of rational number

but this is a contradiction because we suppose that n is irrational but here we get  rational
a number cant be both rational and irrational [thus the contradiction is proven]


Use any method to prove the statements in 26–29.
26. For all integers a, b, and c, if a does not divide bc then a does not divide b. 
prove by contradiction
negation: For some integers a, b, and c, a does not divide bc and a divides b
Suppose not. That is, For some integers a, b, and c, a does not divide bc and a divides b
[we must deduce  a contradiction]

a | b can be written as b = a . q where q is an integer
a does not divide bc = leaves a reminder

bc = (aq) . c
bc = a . (qc)
bc is an integer since integer times integer is an intteger
therefore by the definitino of divisilibty it is divisible
therefore a | bc [thus the supposition is false and statement proved is true]

27. for all positive real nubmers r and s, sqrt(r+s) does not equal sqrt(r) + sqrt(S)
proof by contraposition
contrapositive: For all positive real number r and s, sqrt(r) + sqrt(s) = sqrt(r+s)

(sqrt(r) + sqrt(s))^2 = sqrt(r+s)^2
r + 2.sqrt(rs) + s = rs
2. sqrt(rs) = 0


but we assumed that 2sqrt(rs) > 0 earler so it cannot be both 0 and > 0, therfore the contraposition is false
and the original statment is false

28. for all integers a, b, and c, if a | b and a does not divide c, then a does not divide (b + c)


29. for all integers m and n, if m + n is even then m and n are both even or m and n are both odd

30. a. let n = 53. Find an approximate value for sqrt(n)
and write a list of all the prime numbers less than or equal to sqrt(n)
is the following statement true or false?
wheb n = 53, n is not divisible by and prime number less than or equal to sqrt(n)

b. suppose n is a fixed integer. let S be the statement "n is not divisible by any prime number less than
or equal to sqrt(n)" the following statement is equivalent to S

A (for all) prime number p, if p is less than or equal to sqrt(n), then n is not divisible by p

which of the following are negations for S?
