1. fill in the blank in the following proof by contracdiction that the


 Proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive real number x.
 [We must deduce (a)]
 
Consider the number x/2. Since x is a positive real number, x/2 is also (b).
In addition, we can deduce that x/2 < x by multiplying both sides of the inequality 1 < 2 by 
(c) and dividing (d). Hence x/2 is a positive real number that is less than the least positive real number. 
This is a (e) . [Thus the supposition is false, and so there is no least positive real number.]

answer:
a) a contradiction
b) x
c) 2
d) x
e) contradiction

2. is 1/0 an irrational number? explain
1/0 is not an irrational number because any number dividede by 0 is undefined.
by the definition of irrational number, a number is irrational if it cannot be expressed as ratio of two intergers

3. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is not divisible by 3

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is divisible by 3. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

Since 3n + 2 divisible by 3, we can write it as the following
a = 3
b = 3n + 2
3 | 3n + 2

3n + 2 = 3r 
2 = 3r - 3n
2 = 3(r - n)
let k = (r - n), since integer minus integer is integer, k is an integer
so 2 = 3 . k -> 3 | 2. By the definition of divisibility, 3 does not divide 2 perfect.ly
The contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false, and so 3 does not divide 3n+2]

4. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer m, 7m + 4 is not divisible by 7

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 7m + 4 is divisible by 7. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

a = 7
b = 7m + 4
7 | 7m+4

7m+4 = 7r
4 = 7r - 7m
4 = 7 (r - m)
let k = (r - m), since integer minus integer is an integer therefore k is an integer

so 4 = 7k. -> 7 | 4. By the definition of divisibility, 7 does not divide 4 perfectly.
the contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false and so 7 does not divide 7m + 4]


 Carefully formulate the negations of each of the state
ments in 5–7. then prove each statement by contradiction
5. there is no greatest even integer
a. statement negation
Ax integer n, if n is even, then Ex integer m, with m even and m > n
negation: Ex integer n such that for all even integers m, m <= n

b. prove by contradiction

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a greatest even integer.
[we must deduce a contradiction]

By the definition of even, a number is even if it can be written as n = 2k for some integer k

N <= N + 2
N + 2 is even because even + even = even
N + 2 is bigger than N

but N was supposed to be the greatest even integer and now n + 2 is bigger than N
this is a contradiction. [thus the suposition is false and so there is a greatest even integer is false]

6. there is no greatest negative real number
a. negation: there is a greatest negative real number

b. prove by contradiction
proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a greatest negative real number
[we must deduce a contradiction]

let N = greatest negative real number

N/2 <= N
since n/2 is negative n/2 is bigger than N which is closer to 0.
but we assume N to be the greatest negative real number which is false
therefore its a contradiction. [thus the suposition is false and so there is a greatest negative real number is false]

7. there is no least positive rational number
a. negation: there is a least positive rational number

b. proof:
proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive rational number
[we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of rational number a number is rational if it can be written as r = n / k where k is an integer and does not equal 

let N = least positive rational number
N > N/2

n/2 is a rational number because n is an integer and 2 does not equal 0
if n is positive then n/2 is also positive

we assume N to be the least positive real number but n/2 is smaller actually than N
this is a contradiction [thus the supposition is false and so there is a least positive rational number is false]

8. fill in the blanks for the following proof that thedifference of any rational number and
any rational number is irrational

Proof (by contradiction): Suppose not. That is, suppose that there exist (a) x and  (b) y such that x - y is rational.
By definition of rational, there exist integers a, b, c, and d with b does not equal 0 and d does not equal 0 so that
x = (c) and x - y = (d)

By substitution,


a / b - y = c/d

Adding y and subtracting c/d on both sides gives

y = (e) (by substitution)
= ad / bd - bc / bd
= ad - bc / bd (by algebra)

Now both ad-bc and bd are integers because products and differences of 
(f) are (g). and bd does not equal 0 by the (h). Hence y is a ratio of integers
with a nonzero denominator, and thus y is (i) by definition of rational.

We therefore have both that y is irrational and that y is rational, which is a 
contradiction. [Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.]

a) a rational number x
b) irrational number y
c) a/b
d) c/d
e) a/b - c/d
f) integers
g) integers
h) definition of rational number
i) rational

9. a.  When asked to prove that the difference of any 
irrational number and any rational number is 
irrational, a student began, “Suppose not. That 
is, suppose the difference of any irrational 
number and any rational number is rational.”
 What is wrong with beginning the proof in 
this way? (Hint: If needed, review the answer 
to exercise 11 in Section 3.2.)

answer: the student incorrectly negates the original statement
the correct version is this: Suppose not. that is, suppose the difference of some irrational number and some rational number is rational

b. prove that the differenec of any irrational number and any rational number is irrational
proof: Suppose not. that is, suppose the difference of some irrational number and some rational number is rational
[we must deduce a contradiction]

let r = some rational number
let i = some irrational number

we must prove that i - r = q where q is some rational number
by the definition of rational number, a rational can be written as fraction a/b where a is an integer and b does not equal 0
then we can substitute the definition

i - a/b = c/d
i = a/b + c/d
i = ad + cb / bd
ad + cb is an integer because sum of product of integer is anteger and bd is nonzero
therefore ad + cb / bd is a rational number and i is a rational number. But this contradicts with our assumption that i is irrational.
And i cannot be both rational and irrational. This is a contradiction. [Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.] 


10. let S be the statement: for all positive real numbers r and s, sqrt(r+s) does not equal sqrt(r) + sqrt(s).
Statement S is true but the following "proof" is incorrect. Find the mistake

Proof by contradiction: suppose not. that is, suppose that for all positive real nubers r and s,
sqrt(r+s) equals sqrt(r) + sqrt(s).

This means that the equation will be true no matter what positive real numbers 
are substituted for r and s. So let r = 0 and s = 16. Then r and s are positive real numbers and

sqrt(r+s) = sqrt(9+16) = sqrt(25) = 5

whereas sqrt(r) + sqrt(s) = sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 3 + 4 = 7

since 5 does not equal 7, we have that sqrt(r+s) does not equal sqrt(r) + sqrt(s)
which contradicts the supposition that sqrt(r+s) = sqrt(r) + sqrt(s). this contradiction shows that the supposition is flase
and hence the statement S is true

answer: 
mistakenly negate the original statmeent - negation of For All should be There exists some, so it should be 
For some positive real numbers r and s, sqrt(r+s) equals sqrt(r) + sqrt(s)

11. Let T be the statement: The sum of any two rational numbers is rational.
Then T is true, but the following “proof” is incorrect. Find the mistake.

 “Proof by contradiction: Suppose not. That is, suppose that the sum of any two rational numbers 
is not rational. This means that no matter what two rational numbers are chosen their sum is not rational.

Now both 1 and 3 are rational because 1 = 1/1 and 3 = 3/1, and so both are ratios of 
integers with a nonzero denominator.

Hence, by a supposition, the sum of 1 and 3, which is 4, is not rational.
But 4 is rational because 4 = 4/1, which is a ratio of integers with a nonzero denominator. 

Hence 4 is both rational and not rational, which is a contradiction.
This contradiction shows that the supposition is false, and hence statement T is true.”

answer: the mistake was in the negation. suppose that the sum of any two rational numbers 
is not rational is incorrect. the correct version should be "suppose that there eixts two rational numbers whose sum is not rational"
