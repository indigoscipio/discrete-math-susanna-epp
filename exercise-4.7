answer: the statement is false and you show that the supposition leads to a contradiction

3. to prove a statement of the form Ax E D, if P(x) then Q(x),
by contraposition, you suppose that ___ and you show that ___
answer: x is any [particular but arbirarily chosen element] of D for which ~Q(x) is true, ~P(x) is true

1. fill in the blank in the following proof by contracdiction that the


 Proof: Suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive real number x.
 [We must deduce (a)]
 
Consider the number x/2. Since x is a positive real number, x/2 is also (b).
In addition, we can deduce that x/2 < x by multiplying both sides of the inequality 1 < 2 by 
(c) and dividing (d). Hence x/2 is a positive real number that is less than the least positive real number. 
This is a (e) . [Thus the supposition is false, and so there is no least positive real number.]

answer:
a) a contradiction
b) x
c) 2
d) x
e) contradiction

2. is 1/0 an irrational number? explain
1/0 is not an irrational number because any number dividede by 0 is undefined.
by the definition of irrational number, a number is irrational if it cannot be expressed as ratio of two intergers

3. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is not divisible by 3

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 3n + 2 is divisible by 3. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

Since 3n + 2 divisible by 3, we can write it as the following
a = 3
b = 3n + 2
3 | 3n + 2

3n + 2 = 3r 
2 = 3r - 3n
2 = 3(r - n)
let k = (r - n), since integer minus integer is integer, k is an integer
so 2 = 3 . k -> 3 | 2. By the definition of divisibility, 3 does not divide 2 perfect.ly
The contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false, and so 3 does not divide 3n+2]

4. use proof by contradiction to show that for every integer m, 7m + 4 is not divisible by 7

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that for every integer n, 7m + 4 is divisible by 7. [we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of divisibility, a | b = a . r for some integer r

a = 7
b = 7m + 4
7 | 7m+4

7m+4 = 7r
4 = 7r - 7m
4 = 7 (r - m)
let k = (r - m), since integer minus integer is an integer therefore k is an integer

so 4 = 7k. -> 7 | 4. By the definition of divisibility, 7 does not divide 4 perfectly.
the contradiction is confirmed [thus the supposition is false and so 7 does not divide 7m + 4]


 Carefully formulate the negations of each of the state
ments in 5â€“7. then prove each statement by contradiction
5. there is no greatest even integer
a. statement negation
Ax integer n, if n is even, then Ex integer m, with m even and m > n
negation: Ex integer n such that for all even integers m, m <= n

b. prove by contradiction

proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a greatest even integer.
[we must deduce a contradiction]

By the definition of even, a number is even if it can be written as n = 2k for some integer k

N <= N + 2
N + 2 is even because even + even = even
N + 2 is bigger than N

but N was supposed to be the greatest even integer and now n + 2 is bigger than N
this is a contradiction. [thus the suposition is false and so there is a greatest even integer is false]

6. there is no greatest negative real number
a. negation: there is a greatest negative real number

b. prove by contradiction
proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a greatest negative real number
[we must deduce a contradiction]

let N = greatest negative real number

N/2 <= N
since n/2 is negative n/2 is bigger than N which is closer to 0.
but we assume N to be the greatest negative real number which is false
therefore its a contradiction. [thus the suposition is false and so there is a greatest negative real number is false]

7. there is no least positive rational number
a. negation: there is a least positive rational number

b. proof:
proof: suppose not. That is, suppose that there is a least positive rational number
[we must deduce a contradiction]

by the definition of rational number a number is rational if it can be written as r = n / k where k is an integer and does not equal 

let N = least positive rational number
N > N/2

n/2 is a rational number because n is an integer and 2 does not equal 0
if n is positive then n/2 is also positive

we assume N to be the least positive real number but n/2 is smaller actually than N
this is a contradiction [thus the supposition is false and so there is a least positive rational number is false]

8. fill in the blanks for the following proof that thedifference of any rational number and
any rational number is irrational

 Proof (by contradiction): Suppose not. That is, suppose that there exist (a) x and  (b) y such that x - y is rational.
By definition of rational, there exist integers a, b, c, and d with b does not equal 0 and d does not equal 0 so that
x = (c) and x - y = (d)

By substitution,


a / b - y = c/d

Adding y and subtracting c/d on both sides gives

y = (e) (by substitution)
= ad / bd - bc / bd
= ad - bc / bd (by algebra)


Now both ad-bc and bd are integers because products and differences of 
(f) are (g). and bd does not equal 0 by the (h). Hence y is a ratio of integers
with a nonzero denominator, and thus y is (i) by definition of rational.

We therefore have both that y is irrational and that y is rational, which is a 
contradiction. [Thus the supposition is false and the statement to be proved is true.]

a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)
g)
h)
i)
