Test yourself
1. To establish the truth of a statement of the form 
“Ax in D, Ey in E such that P(x, y),” you imagine 
that someone has given you an element x from 
D but that you have no control over what that el
ement is. Then you need to find ___ with the property
that the x the person gave you together 
with the ____  you subsequently found satisfy ___
answer: at least one element from y, together with the y, satisfy P(x,y)


2. To establish the truth of a statement of the form 
“Ex in D such that Ay in E, P(x, y),” you need 
to find _____  so that no matter what ____ a person might subsequently give you, 
____ will be true.
answer: at least one element x in D, element y, P(x,y)

3.  Consider the statement “Ax, Ey such that P(x, y), a 
property involving x and y, is true.” A negation for 
this statement is _____
answer: Ex, Ay, such that ~(P(x,y))

4. Consider the statement “Ex such that Ay, P(x, y), a 
property involving x and y, is true.” A negation for 
this statement is _____
answer: Ax, such that Ey, ~P(x,y)

5. Suppose P(x, y) is some property involving x and y,
and suppose the statement “Ax in D, E y in E such that P(x, y)” is true.

Then the statement “E x in D such that Ay in E, P(x, y)”

original statement: For all alements x in D, there is at least one y in E such that P(x,y) is true
asked statement: There exists one element x in D such that for all elemenent y in E, P(x,y) is true

a. is true
b. is false
c. may be true or may be false
answer: is false

c. x = 10^10^10
answer: n = 10^10^10^10


The statements in exercises 5–8 refer to the tarski world 
given in Figure 3.3.1. explain why each is true.
Object a (blue circle): row 1, column 3
Object b (gray circle): row 2, column 1
Object c (blue circle): row 2, column 2
Object d (black triangle): row 2, column 4
Object e (black square): row 3, column 1
Object f (gray triangle): row 3, column 3
Object g (gray square): row 3, column 5
Object h (gray square): row 4, column 2
Object i (gray triangle): row 5, column 4
Object j (blue square): row 5, column 5

5.  For every circle x there is a square y such that 
x and y have the same color.
Ax Circle(x), Ex Square(y) such that SameColor(x,y)
circles = b (gray) ,c or a (blue)
squares = e (black),h (gray),g (gray), j (blue)
b (gray) -> h or g (gray)
c or a (blue) -> j (blue)
this statement is true because for all circles you can find at least one square that has the same color as the circle


6.  For every square x there is a circle y such that  
x and y have different colors and y is above x.
Ax Square(x), E Circle(y) such that DifferentColor(x,y) AND IsAbove(y,x)
squares = e (black),h (gray),g (gray), j (blue)
circles = b (gray) ,c or a (blue)
e -> e has different color with gray (true) AND b is above e (true)
e -> true

h -> h has different color with c or a (true) AND c is above h (true
h -> true

g -> g has different color with c or a (true) AND b,c,or a is above g
g -> true

j -> j has different color with b (true) AND b,c,or a is  above j
Therefore this statement is true


7. There is a triangle x such that for every square  
y, x is above y.
Ex Triangle(x), Ax Square(y), IsAbove(x,y)
triangles: d,f,i
squares: e,g,h,j
d -> is d above square e ? yes.
d -> is d above square g ? yes
d -> is d above square h ? yes.
d -> is d above square j? yes.
Therfore the statement is true 


8. There is a triangle x such that for every circle y,  
y is above x.
Ax Triangle(x), E circle(y), IsAbove(y,x)
triangles: d,f,i
circles = b,c, a 
d -> is circle b above d? false
f -> is circle b above f? true
f -> is circle c above f? true
f -> is circle a above f? true
therefore the statement is true 


9. Let D = E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. Explain why the 
following statements are true.
a. A(All)x in D, E(some)y in E such that x+y = 0
D = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
All elements x in d, there is some y in e such that x + y = 0
which means for all given D, there is an opposite number that makes x + y = 0
x = -2 -> y = 2
x = -1 -> y = 1
x = 0 -> y = 0
x = 1 -> y = -1
x = 2 -> y = -2
therefore the statement is true

b. Ex in D such that Ay in E, x+y = y
There exists at least one x in D such that for all y in E, x + y = y 
which means you can pick at least one element in d that satisfies x + y = y for all element y
D = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}

let x = 0, y = -2 -> x + y = -2
let x = 0, y = -1 -> x + y = -1
let x = 0, y = 0 -> x + y = 0
let x = 0, y = 1 -> x + y = 1
let x = 0, y = 2 -> x + y = 2
therefore the statement is true
