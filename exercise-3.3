5.  For every circle x there is a square y such that 
x and y have the same color.
Ax Circle(x), Ex Square(y) such that SameColor(x,y)
circles = b (gray) ,c or a (blue)
squares = e (black),h (gray),g (gray), j (blue)
b (gray) -> h or g (gray)
c or a (blue) -> j (blue)
this statement is true because for all circles you can find at least one square that has the same color as the circle


6.  For every square x there is a circle y such that  
x and y have different colors and y is above x.
Ax Square(x), E Circle(y) such that DifferentColor(x,y) AND IsAbove(y,x)
squares = e (black),h (gray),g (gray), j (blue)
circles = b (gray) ,c or a (blue)
e -> e has different color with gray (true) AND b is above e (true)
e -> true

h -> h has different color with c or a (true) AND c is above h (true
h -> true

g -> g has different color with c or a (true) AND b,c,or a is above g
g -> true

j -> j has different color with b (true) AND b,c,or a is  above j
Therefore this statement is true


7. There is a triangle x such that for every square  
y, x is above y.
Ex Triangle(x), Ax Square(y), IsAbove(x,y)
triangles: d,f,i
squares: e,g,h,j
d -> is d above square e ? yes.
d -> is d above square g ? yes
d -> is d above square h ? yes.
d -> is d above square j? yes.
Therfore the statement is true

triangles: d,f,i
circles = b,c, a

following statements are true.
a. A(All)x in D, E(some)y in E such that x+y = 0
D = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
All elements x in d, there is some y in e such that x + y = 0
which means for all given D, there is an opposite number that makes x + y = 0
x = -2 -> y = 2
x = -1 -> y = 1
x = 0 -> y = 0
x = 1 -> y = -1
x = 2 -> y = -2
therefore the statement is true

b. Ex in D such that Ay in E, x+y = y
There exists at least one x in D such that for all y in E, x + y = y 
which means you can pick at least one element in d that satisfies x + y = y for all element y
D = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}

let x = 0, y = -2 -> x + y = -2
let x = 0, y = -1 -> x + y = -1
let x = 0, y = 0 -> x + y = 0
let x = 0, y = 1 -> x + y = 1
let x = 0, y = 2 -> x + y = 2
therefore the statement is true

20. Recall that reversing the order of the quantifiers 
in a statement with two different quantifiers may
change the truth value of the statement—but it 
does not necessarily do so. All the statements in 
the pairs below refer to the Tarski world of Figure

reversed but everything else is the same. For each 
pair, determine whether the statements have  
the same or opposite truth values. Justify your

this means we need to find at least one circle AND one square.
such that a circle is above a square and that circle has different color with that square
circles: a,b,c

b. negation: there is a person x such that for all persons y, x does not trust y

36. somebody trusts everybody
a. There is a person x such that for all person y, x trusts y
b. negaiton: For all persons x, there is a person y such that x does not trust y

37. any even integer equals twice some integer
a. for all even integer x, there is an integer y such that x = 2y

40. In informal speech most sentences of the form 
“There is ___ every ___ understood as meaning “A ___ E ____”
are intended to be even though the existential quantifier there is comes 
before the universal quantifier every. Note that 
this interpretation applies to the following well-known sentences.
Rewrite them using quantifiers and variables.
a. there is a sucker born every minute
For all sucker x, there is a minute y such that x is born every y

b. there is a time for eveyr purpose under heaven
For all time x, there is a purpose y such that x is under y.

41. Indicate which of the following statements are true 
and which are false. Justify your answers as best you can.

a. Ax E Z+, Ey E Z+ such that  x = y + 1
x = all positive integers
y = at least one positive integer
x = y + 1
1 = 0 + 1
this is false because when x is 1, no y can be found in the positive integer 

b. Ax E Z, Ey E Z such that x = y + 1
x = all integer
y = at least one integer
this is true because you can choose at least one y for all given x

c. Ex E R such that Ay E R, x = y+1
x = At least one real number
y = all real number
x = y + 1
x = y + 1
let y = 0 -> x = 1
let y = 1 -> x = 2
let y = 2 -> x = 3
etc
therefore this statement is false because no single x can satisfy y + 1

d. Ax E R+, Ey E R+ such that xy = 1
x = All positive rela number
y = At least one positive real number
xy = 1
which means we need to find at least one y that can satisfy xy = 1
y = 1/ All positive real number
this is correct/true since we can find y for all x


e. Ax E R, Ey E R such that xy = 1
x = all rational number
y = at least one rational number such that xy = 1
which means we need to find at least ony y that can satisfy xy = 1
y = 1/x, where x is all rational nubmer

y = 1/0 - cant be divided by 0 since its undefined, only works for nonzero number
therefore this statement is false 


f. Ex E R such that Ay E R, x + y = y
x = at least one real number e
y = all rational number y
we need to find at least one real number x that satisfies x+y=y such that y = all real number
x = y - y
I think this is true because if you minus a number by itself it should be 0
x is 0


g. Ax E R+, Ey E R+ such that y < x
x = all positive real number
y = choose a real number such that y < x
we need to find at least one y that satisfies y < x, where x is any positive real number
y < x
0.00000001 < 0.00001
Yes, this statement is true because we can always find a small positive real unmber y

h. Ex E R+ such that Ay E R+, x <= y
x = at least one positive real number
y = all positive real number
we need to pick a x that satisfies x <= y, where y is all positive real number
0.00001 <= 0.00001
therefore the statement is false because you can always find a smaller value

42. Write the negation of the definition of limit of a sequence given in Example 3.3.7
Ae > 0, E an iteger N such that A integer n, if n > N then L - e < an < L + e
I don't know anything about limit but i'l give this one a shot
negation: Ee <= 0, A an integer N such that E integer n, n > N AND L - e >= an >= L + e

43The following is the definition for lim x->a  f(x) = L:

For every real number E > 0,
there exists a real number d > 0 such that for every real number x,
if a - d < x < a + d and x does not equal to a then L - e < f(x) < L + e

Ax real number E > 0, Ex real number D > 0 such that Ax real number x,

Write what it means for lim x->a f(a) does not equal to L.
In other words, write the negation of the definition.

negation:There exists real number E <=0, for all real number d <= 0, thre exists a real number x,
a - d >= x >= a + d and x is equal to a AND L - e >= f(x) >= L + 3

44.  The notation E! stands for the words “there exists 
a unique.” Thus, for instance, “E! x such that x 
is prime and x is even” means that there is one 
and only one even prime number. Which of the 
following statements are true and which are false? 
Explain.

a. E! real number x such that A real number  y, xy = y.
There exists only one real number x such that for all y, xy = y
x = y/y
y can be undefined but if x is 1 the statement is true

b. E! integer x such that 1/x is an integer
There exists only one integer x such that 1/x is an integer
 if x is 1 -> 1/1 = 1
 if x is -11 -> 1/1 = -1
therefore this statement is false

c. A real number x, E! real number y such that x + y = 0
For all real nubmer x, there is a unique rela number y such that x + y = 0
true since you can zero a number if you minus it by itself

45. Suppose that P(x) is a predicate and D is the 
domain of x. Rewrite the statement
E! x E D such that P(x) without using the symbol E!.
(See exercise 44 for the meaning of E!.)

There is one and only x such that p(x) is true
rewrite: There exists a number x such that P(x) is true and XXX
yeah i don't know this one

46.  In 46–54, refer to the tarski world given in Figure 3.1.1, 
which is shown again here for reference. the domains of 
all variables consist of all the objects in the tarski world. 
For each statement, (a) indicate whether the statement is true or false and justify your answer, (b) write the given 
statement using the formal logical notation illustrated in 
example 3.3.10, and (c) write a negation for the given state
ment using the formal logical notation of example 3.3.10.
