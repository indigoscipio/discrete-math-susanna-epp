1. To establish the truth of a statement of the form 
“Ax in D, Ey in E such that P(x, y),” you imagine 
that someone has given you an element x from 
D but that you have no control over what that el
ement is. Then you need to find ___ with the property
that the x the person gave you together 
with the ____  you subsequently found satisfy ___
answer: at least one element from y, together with the y, satisfy P(x,y)

The statements in exercises 5–8 refer to the tarski world 
given in Figure 3.3.1. explain why each is true.
TARSKI FIGURE3.3.1
Object a (blue circle): row 1, column 3
Object b (gray circle): row 2, column 1
Object c (blue circle): row 2, column 2
Object d (black triangle): row 2, column 4
Object e (black square): row 3, column 1
Object f (gray triangle): row 3, column 3
Object g (gray square): row 3, column 5
Object h (gray square): row 4, column 2
Object i (gray triangle): row 5, column 4
Object j (blue square): row 5, column 5

5.  For every circle x there is a square y such that 
x and y have the same color.
Ax Circle(x), Ex Square(y) such that SameColor(x,y)
circles = b (gray) ,c or a (blue)
squares = e (black),h (gray),g (gray), j (blue)
b (gray) -> h or g (gray)
c or a (blue) -> j (blue)
this statement is true because for all circles you can find at least one square that has the same color as the circle


6.  For every square x there is a circle y such that  
x and y have different colors and y is above x.
Ax Square(x), E Circle(y) such that DifferentColor(x,y) AND IsAbove(y,x)
squares = e (black),h (gray),g (gray), j (blue)
circles = b (gray) ,c or a (blue)
e -> e has different color with gray (true) AND b is above e (true)
e -> true

h -> h has different color with c or a (true) AND c is above h (true
h -> true

g -> g has different color with c or a (true) AND b,c,or a is above g
g -> true

j -> j has different color with b (true) AND b,c,or a is  above j
Therefore this statement is true


7. There is a triangle x such that for every square  
y, x is above y.
Ex Triangle(x), Ax Square(y), IsAbove(x,y)
triangles: d,f,i
squares: e,g,h,j
d -> is d above square e ? yes.
d -> is d above square g ? yes
d -> is d above square h ? yes.
d -> is d above square j? yes.
Therfore the statement is true 


8. There is a triangle x such that for every circle y,  
y is above x.
Ax Triangle(x), E circle(y), IsAbove(y,x)
triangles: d,f,i
circles = b,c, a 
d -> is circle b above d? false
f -> is circle b above f? true
f -> is circle c above f? true
f -> is circle a above f? true
therefore the statement is true 


9. Let D = E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. Explain why the 
following statements are true.
a. A(All)x in D, E(some)y in E such that x+y = 0
D = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
All elements x in d, there is some y in e such that x + y = 0
which means for all given D, there is an opposite number that makes x + y = 0
x = -2 -> y = 2
x = -1 -> y = 1
x = 0 -> y = 0
x = 1 -> y = -1
x = 2 -> y = -2
therefore the statement is true

b. Ex in D such that Ay in E, x+y = y
There exists at least one x in D such that for all y in E, x + y = y 
which means you can pick at least one element in d that satisfies x + y = y for all element y
D = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
E = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}

let x = 0, y = -2 -> x + y = -2
let x = 0, y = -1 -> x + y = -1
let x = 0, y = 0 -> x + y = 0
let x = 0, y = 1 -> x + y = 1
let x = 0, y = 2 -> x + y = 2
therefore the statement is true

This exercise refers to Example 3.3.3. Determine 
whether each of the following statements is true or 
false.

stations:
salads: green salad, fruid salad
main courses: spaghetti, fish
desserts: pie, cake
beverages: milk, soda, coffee

students:
uta -> green salad, spaghetti, pie, milk
tim -> fruit salad, fish, pie, milk, coffee
yuen -> spaghetti, fish, pie, soda


a. A student S, E a dessert D such that s choose D
For all student s, there is at least one desert D such that S chose D
studesnts: uta, tim, yuen
which means these 3 students needs to choose the same dessert D
answr: true: tim, uta, and yuen choose all pie for dessert


b. A student S, E a salad T such that S chose T
For all stuedent S, there is at least a salad T such that S chose T
which means we need to find a case where all students needs to choose the salad same salad T
answer: false, there is no case where all 3 students choose the same salad
(uta choose green salad and tim choose fruit alad, yuen didn't pick up any salads at all)

c. E a dessert D such that A student S, S chose D.
There is at least one dessert D such that for all student S, S chose D
this is the same as question a - desert that was chosen by all students.
desert: pie, cake
student: uta, tim, yuen
answer: true (pie satisfies this)


d. E a beverage B such that A student D. D chose B.
There is at least a beverage B such that for all student D, D chose B
which means we need to find a case where there is a beverage that was chosen by all student
answer: false (the closest is milk cwhich was chosen by uta and tim but yen chose soda)

e. E an item I such that A student S, S did not choose I
There is at an item I such that for all student S, S did ont choose I
which means we need to find a case where there is an item I that was NOT chosen by all student
Find an item that was not chosen by all of the students
answer: false - all items were chosen by the student

f. E a station Z such that A student S, E an item I such that S chose I from Z
There is a station Z such that for all student S, there is an item I such that S chose I from Z
Which means
all student chose at least one item from at least one station
answer: true; student picks up at least one food from at least one station

answer: There is two different students where if one has seen a movie, then the other one has seen that movie too.

12. Let D = E{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. Write negations 
for each of the following statements and determine 
which is true, the given statement or its negation.

a. Ax in D, Ey in E such that x+y = 1.
for all x in d, there is at least one y such that x + y = 1
we need to check if all x in d and at least one y satisfies x + y = 1
remember result needs to be 1
x = -2, y = None
x = -1, y = 2 
x = 0, y =  1
x = 1, y =  -2  
x = 2, y =   None 

now the negation
Ax in D, Ey in E such that x+y = 1
Ex in D, Ay in E such that x+y does not equal to 1
There exists at least one x in D such that for all y in E, x +y does not equal to 1
we need to check if theres at least one element x in D 
x=-2, y=-2 -> -4
x=-2, y=-1 -> -3
x=-2, y=0 -> -2
x=-2, y=1 -> -1

answer: the negation is true since -2 satisfies the given statment

b. Ex in D such that Ay in E, x + y = -y

x=0,y=-2
x=0,y=-1
x=0,y=0
x=0,y=1
x=0,y=2

now the negation
Ex in D such that Ay in E, x + y = -y
Ax in D such that Ey in E, x + y does not equal to -y
x=-2,y=2 -> 0
x=-1,y=2 -> 1

x=0,y=-1 -> 0
x=0,y=-2 -> 0
x=0,y=0 -> 0
x=0,y=1 -> 0
x=0,y=2 -> 0

seems to be false

20. Recall that reversing the order of the quantifiers 
in a statement with two different quantifiers may
change the truth value of the statement—but it 
does not necessarily do so. All the statements in 
the pairs below refer to the Tarski world of Figure 
3.3.1. In each pair, the order of the quantifiers is 
reversed but everything else is the same. For each 
pair, determine whether the statements have  
the same or opposite truth values. Justify your 
answers.

a.
(1) For every square y there is a triangle x such 
that x and y have different colors.
Ax Square(y), Ex Triangle(x), DifferentColor(x,y)
squares = e (black), h or g (gray),j (blue)
triangle = d (black),f or i (gray)
e (black) -> f or i (gray)
h or g(gray) -> d (black)
j -> d or f or i

therefore 1 is true

(2) There is a triangle x such that for every 
square y, x and y have different colors.
Ex Triangle(x), Ax Square(y), DifferentColor(x,y)
triangle = d (black),f or i (gray)
squares = e (black), h or g (gray),j (blue)
f or i -> e (blakc)
f or i -> h or g (gray)
f or i -> j (blue)

This is  false because no single triangle has a different color from all squares. 

b. 
(1) For every circle y there is a square x such 
that x and y have the same color.
Ax Circle(y), Ex Square(x) such that SameColor(x,y)
circles: a or c (blue), b (gray)
squares: squares = e (black), h or g (gray),j (blue)
a or c -> j (true)
b -> h or g (true)

therefore this is true


(2) There is a square x such that for every 
circle y, x and y have the same color.
Ex Square(x), Ax Circle(y) -> SameColor(x,y)
squares = e (black), h or g (gray),j (blue)
circles: a or c (blue), b (gray)
none -> a or c (blue)
none -> b (gray)

There fore this is false
