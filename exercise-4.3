8. the zero product property says that if a product of two real numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be 0

a. Write this property formally using quantifiers and variables.
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a + b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0

b. Write the contrapositive of your answer to part (a).
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0, then a + b does not equal 0

c. Write an informal version (without quantifier symbols or variables) for your answer to part (b).
If two numbers are nonzero then the sum of those numbers does not equal 0

9. Assume that a and b are both integers and that
a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0.
Explain why (b-a)/(ab^2) must be a rational number

Suppose a and b is any particular but arbitrarily chosen nonzero integer [we must show that (b-a)/(ab^2) is a rational number]


(b - a) / (ab^2)
let p = (b-a), since any integer minus any integer is an integer p is integer
let q = (ab^2), since any integer times any integer squared is integer, q is an integer
Additionally, since a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0 we know that q does not eual 0.

by the definition of rational number, r = a/b where a is a and b is an integer and b does not equal 0,
therefore we can substitute -> r = p/q where p and q is an integer and q does not euql to 0
Thus the statement is a rational number and satisfies the form (b - a) / (ab^2) = p/q

10 Assume that m and n are both integers and that n does not equal to 0.
Explain why (5m-12n)/(4n) must be a rational number.
Suppose m and n are any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer whre both does not equal to 0 [we must show that (5m-12n)/(4n) is a rational nubmer]

m = n = does not equal to 0
(5m-12n)/(4n)

let p = 5m-12n. Since any integer minus any integer p is also an integer
let q = 4n. 4 times any nonzero integer is an integer.
Additionally, since n does not eual to 0, we know 4n does not equal to 0, so q does not equal to 0

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q does not equal to 0
Therefore, since (5m-12n)/(4n) satisfies this form, it must be a rational nujmber


11. Prove that every integer is a rational number
Suppose n is any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer [we must show that n is a rational number]

By the definiton of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as p/q
where p and q are integers and q does not equal to 0

We can write every integer in this form: n = n/1 where n is an integer and 1 is a nonzero integer.
Since this satisfies the definition of a rational number, every integer is rational.
therefore it is true [as was to be shown]

12. Let S be the statement
“The square of any rational number is rational.”
A formal version of S is “For every rational number r, r^2 is rational.”
Fill in the blanks in the proof for S.

Proof: suppose that r is (a). by the definition of rational, r = a/b for some (b)
with b does not equal 0. By substitution, r = (c) = a^2/b^2
Since a and b are both integers, so are the products a^2 and (d). also b^2 does not equal 0 by the (e)
hence r^2 is a ratio of two integers with a nonzero denominator and so (f) by htedefinition of rational

answer: 
a. a rational number
b. integer a and b
c. (a/b)^2
d. b^2
e. nonzero property
f. r^2

13. Consider the following statement: The negative of any rational number is rational
a. Write the statement formally using a quantifier and a variable.
answer: Ax number x, if x is rational, then -x is rational

b. Determine whether the statement is true or false and justify your answer. 
answer:
suppose x is any particular but arbitrarly chosen rational number [we must show that -x is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b
x = a/b
-x = -(a/b)

Since a is still integer (because negative integer is still integer) and b is also still integer (same reason).
Additionally, b is nonzero and therefore this fits the definition of rational number

14. consider the statement: the cube of any rational number is a rational number
a. write the statement formally using a quantifier and variable
answwer: Ax number x,  if is rational then x^3 is rational number 

b.determine wheter the statement is true or false and justify your answer
answer:
suppose x is any particular but arbitrarily chosen rational number [we must show that x^3 is rational]
By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b

x^3
= (a/b)^3
= a^3/b^3

A is an integer because the product of integers is still integer
B is an integer because the product of integers is still integer
Additionally, b is also non zero. Therefore, by the defitnition of rational number, x^3 fits the form and it is a rational number

Determine which of the statements in 15–19 are true 
and which are false. prove each true statement directly 
from the definitions, and give a counterexample for each 
false statement. For a statement that is false, determine 
whether a small change would make it true. If so, make 
the change and prove the new statement. Follow the 
directions for writing proofs on page 173.

15. the product of any two rational numbers is a rational number
Theorem: Ax number x, Ax number y, if x and y is rational, x * y is rational

Proof:
Suppose x and y are arbitrarily chosen rational number. [we must show that x * y is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b
Where a and b is any integer and b does not equal to zero

Let x = p/q where p and q is integer and q is nonzero 
let y = r/s where r and s in integer and s is nonzero

Then we can substitute
p/q * r/s
= pr/qs

let k = pr. pr is an integer because any integer times any integer is integer. therefore k is an integer
let m = qs. qs is an integer because any integer times any integer is integer.
Additionally , q s is also nonzero
Then by the defitnition of rational number, k/m is a rational
Threfore x * y is rational

16. The quotient of any two rational numbers is a rational number.
Ax number a and b, if a and b is rational, a/b is rational
suppose a and b is any particular but arbitrary chosen rational number. [we must show that a/b is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a rational number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b are integers and b doe snot equal 0

let a = p/q where p and q are both integers and q does not equal to 0
let b = r/s where r and s are both integers and s does not equal to 0

then we can substitute
(p/q) / (r/s)
= p/q . s/r
= ps/qr

let k = ps. since any integer times integer is an integer, ps is an integer, therefore, k is an integer
let m = qr. since any integer times integer is an integer, qr is an integer, therefore, m is an integer
additionally, qr does noe equal to 0, therefore m does not equal to 0
Then by the definition of rational number, k/m is rational and therefore a/b is rational. [as was shown] 


17. The difference of any two rational numbers is a rational number.
Ax number a and b, if a anb b is rational, a - b is rational
suppose a and b are any particular rational number [we must show a - b is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a rational number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b are integers and b doe snot equal 0

let a = p/q where p and q are both integers and q does not equal to 0
let b = r/s where r and s are both integers and s does not equal to 0
Then we can substitute
(p/q)-(r/s)
= ps-rq/qs

let k = ps-rq. since any integer times integer minus integer is an integer, ps-rq is an integer, therefore k is an integer
let m = qs. since any integer times integer is an integer, qr is an integer, therefore, m is an integer
additionally, qs does noe equal to 0, therefore m does not equal to 0
Then by the definition of rational number, k/m is rational and therefore a-b is rational.

18. If r and s are any two rational numbers, then r + s / 2 is rational.
Ax number s and r, if s and r is rational, then r + s /2 is rational

Suppose s and r are any parciular rational number [we must show that r + s / 2 is rational]
By the definition of rational number, a rational number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b are integers and b doe snot equal 0

let s = a/b where a and b are both integers and b does not equal to 0
let r = c/d where c and d are both integers and d does not equal to 0
Then we can substitute

r + s / 2
= (a/b + c/d) / 2
= (ad + cb / bd) / 2
= ad + cb / 2bd

let k = (ad + cb). since any integer times integer plus integer is an integer, ad+cb is an integer, therefore k is an integer
let m = 2nd. since any integer times 2 is an integer, 2bd is an integer, therefore, m is an integer
additionally, 2bd does noe equal to 0, therefore m does not equal to 0
Then by the definition of rational number, ad + cb / 2bd is rational and therefore r + s / 2 is rational.

19. for all real numbers a and b, if a < b then a < ((a + b) / 2)  < b
(You may use the properties of inequalities in T17–T27 of Appendix A.)
Ax real number a and b, if a < b then (a < (a + b) < b)

Suppose a and b are any particular real number [we must show that if a < b then (a < (a + b) < b)]
First, we must show that a < (a + b) / 2
= 2a < a + b
= a < (a + b) / 2

Second, we must show that (a + b) / 2 < b
= a + b < 2b
= (a + b) / 2 < b

Since we have shown that a < (a + b) / 2 and (a + b) / 2 < b, the statement is proven

20. Use the results of exercises 18 and 19 to prove that given any two rational numbers r and s with r < s there is another rational number between r and s.
An important consequence is that there are infinitely many rational numbers in between any two distinct rational numbers.
See Section 7.4.

From exercise 18 -  If r and s are any two rational numbers, then r + s / 2 is rational.
Ax number s and r, if s and r is rational, then r + s /2 is rational

Given any two rational numbers r and s, there is another rational number between r and s.
Since we know that r + s / 2 is rational from exercise 18
and r < r + 2 / 2 < s from exercise 19, we cna conclude that thre is always a rational number between any two rational numbers
By repeatedly applying this process (taking midpoints again and again), we can generate infinitely many rational numbers between any two distinct rational numbers.

Use the properties of even and odd integers that are 
listed in example 4.3.3 to do exercises 21–23. Indicate 
which properties you use to justify your reasoning.

========
Example 4.3.3 Deriving Additional Results about Even and Odd Integers
 Suppose that you have already proved the following properties of even and odd integers:
 1. The sum, product, and difference of any two even integers are even.
 2. The sum and difference of any two odd integers are even.
 3. The product of any two odd integers is odd.

 4. The product of any even integer and any odd integer is even.

 5. The sum of any odd integer and any even integer is odd.

 6. The difference of any odd integer minus any even integer is odd.
 7. The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd.
 ========

21. True or false? If m is any even integer and n is any odd integer, then m^2 + 3n is odd. Explain
Ax integer m, Ax integer n, if m is even and n is odd -> m^2 + 3n is odd

m (even) ^ 2 (even) = even by property 1,
3 (odd). n (odd) = odd by propert 3
Therefore by using substitution
even + odd =  odd by property 5

22. True or false? if a is any odd integer, then a^2 + a is even. Explain
Ax integer a, if a is odd, then a^2 + a is even

a^2 = a . a = odd . odd = odd by property 3
a = odd by the given statement
therefore we can substitute -> odd + odd = even by property 2

23. True or false? if k is any even integer and m is any odd integer, then (k+2)^2 - (m-1)^2 is even. explain
Ax integer k, Ax integer m, if k is even and m is odd, (k+2)^2 - (m-1)^2 is even

First we must check each of the expression
(k + 2) ^ 2
= (even + even) . (even + even)
= even . even - by propert 1
= even - by property 1

(m - 1) ^ 2
= (odd - odd) . (odd - odd)
= even . even - by property 2
= even - by property 1

Then we can substitute back
even - even
= even - by property 1

Derive the statements in 24–26 as corollaries of theorems 4.3.1, 4.3.2,
and the results of exercises 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.
result of exercise 12: The square of any rational number is rational.
result of exercise 13: the negative of any rational number is rational
result of exercise 14: the cube of any rational number is rational
result of exercise 15: the product of any two rational numbers is a rational number
result of exercise 17: the diffrence of any two rational numbers is a rational number

theorems 4.3.1:  Every integer is a rational number.
theorem 4.3.2: The sum of any two rational numbers is rational

24. For any rational numbers r and s, 2r + 3s is rational
First, have to derive 2r and 3s
2r -> 2 (integer) times rational number
By theorem 4.3.1, 2 is also a rational number, then we can substitute
rational number . rational number
by result of exercise 15, we conclude that rational number times rational number is a rational number

Secondly, we must show that 3s is rational
3s -> 3 (integer) times rational number s
By theorem 4.3.1, 3 is also a rational number, then we can substitute
rational number . rational number
by result of exercise 15, we conclude that rational number times rational number is a rational number

Finally, we can put everything in
rational number + rational number
by theorem 4.3.2, rational number + rational number = rational number
[as was to be shown]

25. if r is any rational number, ten 3r^2 - 2r + 4 is rational
We have to derive and break down each expression
3r ^ 2
= 3 (integer) . r (rational) ^ 2
= rational (by theorem 4.3.1) . rational (by exercise 12)
= rational (by exercise 15)

2r + 4
= 2 (integer) . r (rational) + 4 (integer)
= (rational (by theorem 4.3.1) . rational) + rational (by theorem 4.3.1)
= rational (by exercise 15) + rational
= rational (by theorem 4.3.2)
Then we can plug in 3r^2 - 2r + 4
rational - rational
= rational (by exercise 17) [as was to be shown]

26. for any rational number s, 5s^3 + 8s^2 - 7 is rational
First we must evaluate each expression
5s^3
= 5 (integer) . s^3 (rational by exercise 14)
= rational (by theorem 4.3.1) . rational
= rational (by exercise 15)



8s^2 - 7
