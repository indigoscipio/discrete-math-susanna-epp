exercise set 4.3

1. -35/6 = -35/6
2. 4.6037 = 4.6037/1
3. 4/5 + 2/9 = 46/45
4. 0.3737373737... = 37/99
5. 0.5656565... = 56/99
6. 320.5492492492... = 320.54924924... / 1
7. 52.4672167216... = 526584533/9999000

8. the zero product property says that if a product of two real numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be 0

a. Write this property formally using quantifiers and variables.
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a + b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0

b. Write the contrapositive of your answer to part (a).
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0, then a + b does not equal 0

c. Write an informal version (without quantifier symbols or variables) for your answer to part (b).
If two numbers are nonzero then the sum of those numbers does not equal 0

9. Assume that a and b are both integers and that
a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0.
Explain why (b-a)/(ab^2) must be a rational number

Suppose a and b is any particular but arbitrarily chosen nonzero integer [we must show that (b-a)/(ab^2) is a rational number]


(b - a) / (ab^2)
let p = (b-a), since any integer minus any integer is an integer p is integer
let q = (ab^2), since any integer times any integer squared is integer, q is an integer
Additionally, since a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0 we know that q does not eual 0.

by the definition of rational number, r = a/b where a is a and b is an integer and b does not equal 0,
therefore we can substitute -> r = p/q where p and q is an integer and q does not euql to 0
Thus the statement is a rational number and satisfies the form (b - a) / (ab^2) = p/q

10 Assume that m and n are both integers and that n does not equal to 0.
Explain why (5m-12n)/(4n) must be a rational number.
Suppose m and n are any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer whre both does not equal to 0 [we must show that (5m-12n)/(4n) is a rational nubmer]

m = n = does not equal to 0
(5m-12n)/(4n)

let p = 5m-12n. Since any integer minus any integer p is also an integer
let q = 4n. 4 times any nonzero integer is an integer.
Additionally, since n does not eual to 0, we know 4n does not equal to 0, so q does not equal to 0

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q does not equal to 0
Therefore, since (5m-12n)/(4n) satisfies this form, it must be a rational nujmber


11. Prove that every integer is a rational number
Suppose n is any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer [we must show that n is a rational number]

By the definiton of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as p/q
where p and q are integers and q does not equal to 0

We can write every integer in this form: n = n/1 where n is an integer and 1 is a nonzero integer.
Since this satisfies the definition of a rational number, every integer is rational.
therefore it is true [as was to be shown]

12. Let S be the statement
“The square of any rational number is rational.”
A formal version of S is “For every rational number r, r^2 is rational.”
Fill in the blanks in the proof for S.

Proof: suppose that r is (a). by the definition of rational, r = a/b for some (b)
with b does not equal 0. By substitution, r = (c) = a^2/b^2
Since a and b are both integers, so are the products a^2 and (d). also b^2 does not equal 0 by the (e)
hence r^2 is a ratio of two integers with a nonzero denominator and so (f) by htedefinition of rational

answer: 
a. a rational number
b. integer a and b
c. (a/b)^2
d. b^2
e. nonzero property
f. r^2

13. Consider the following statement: The negative of any rational number is rational
a. Write the statement formally using a quantifier and a variable.
answer: Ax number x, if x is rational, then -x is rational

b. Determine whether the statement is true or false and justify your answer. 
answer:
suppose x is any particular but arbitrarly chosen rational number [we must show that -x is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b
x = a/b
-x = -(a/b)

Since a is still integer (because negative integer is still integer) and b is also still integer (same reason).
Additionally, b is nonzero and therefore this fits the definition of rational number

14. consider the statement: the cube of any rational number is a rational number
a. write the statement formally using a quantifier and variable
answwer: Ax number x,  if is rational then x^3 is rational number 

b.determine wheter the statement is true or false and justify your answer
answer:
suppose x is any particular but arbitrarily chosen rational number [we must show that x^3 is rational]
By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b

x^3
= (a/b)^3
= a^3/b^3

A is an integer because the product of integers is still integer
B is an integer because the product of integers is still integer
Additionally, b is also non zero. Therefore, by the defitnition of rational number, x^3 fits the form and it is a rational number

Determine which of the statements in 15–19 are true 
and which are false. prove each true statement directly 
from the definitions, and give a counterexample for each 
false statement. For a statement that is false, determine 
whether a small change would make it true. If so, make 
the change and prove the new statement. Follow the 
directions for writing proofs on page 173.

15. the product of any two rational numbers is a rational number
Theorem: Ax number x, Ax number y, if x and y is rational, x * y is rational

Proof:
Suppose x and y are arbitrarily chosen rational number. [we must show that x * y is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b
Where a and b is any integer and b does not equal to zero

Let x = p/q where p and q is integer and q is nonzero 
let y = r/s where r and s in integer and s is nonzero

Then we can substitute
p/q * r/s
= pr/qs

let k = pr. pr is an integer because any integer times any integer is integer. therefore k is an integer
let m = qs. qs is an integer because any integer times any integer is integer.
Additionally , q s is also nonzero
Then by the defitnition of rational number, k/m is a rational
Threfore x * y is rational

16. The quotient of any two rational numbers is a rational number.

17. The difference of any two rational numbers is a rational number.

18. If r and s are any two rational numbers, then r + 2 / 2 is rational.
