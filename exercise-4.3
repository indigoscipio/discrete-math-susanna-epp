1. to show that a real number is rational, we must show that we can write it as ___
answer: a/b where a and b is integer and b does not equal to 0
answer: ratio of integers with a nonzero denominoator

2. an irrational number is a ___ that is ____
answer: real number that is not rational

3. zero is a rational number because ___
answer: zero can still be dividided by 1 which returns the number itself

exercise set 4.3
the numbers in 1â€“7 are all rational. Write each number as a ratio of two integers.
1. -35/6 = -35/6
2. 4.6037 = 4.6037/1
3. 4/5 + 2/9 = 46/45
4. 0.3737373737... = 37/99
5. 0.5656565... = 56/99
6. 320.5492492492... = 320.54924924... / 1
7. 52.4672167216... = 526584533/9999000

8. the zero product property says that if a product of two real numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be 0

a. Write this property formally using quantifiers and variables.
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a + b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0

b. Write the contrapositive of your answer to part (a).
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0, then a + b does not equal 0

c. Write an informal version (without quantifier symbols or variables) for your answer to part (b).
If two numbers are nonzero then the sum of those numbers does not equal 0

9. Assume that a and b are both integers and that
a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0.
Explain why (b-a)/(ab^2) must be a rational number

Suppose a and b is any particular but arbitrarily chosen nonzero integer [we must show that (b-a)/(ab^2) is a rational number]
