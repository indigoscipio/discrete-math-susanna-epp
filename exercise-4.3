8. the zero product property says that if a product of two real numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be 0

a. Write this property formally using quantifiers and variables.
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a + b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0

b. Write the contrapositive of your answer to part (a).
answer: Ax real number a, Ax real number b, if a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0, then a + b does not equal 0

c. Write an informal version (without quantifier symbols or variables) for your answer to part (b).
If two numbers are nonzero then the sum of those numbers does not equal 0

9. Assume that a and b are both integers and that
a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0.
Explain why (b-a)/(ab^2) must be a rational number

Suppose a and b is any particular but arbitrarily chosen nonzero integer [we must show that (b-a)/(ab^2) is a rational number]


(b - a) / (ab^2)
let p = (b-a), since any integer minus any integer is an integer p is integer
let q = (ab^2), since any integer times any integer squared is integer, q is an integer
Additionally, since a does not equal 0 and b does not equal 0 we know that q does not eual 0.

by the definition of rational number, r = a/b where a is a and b is an integer and b does not equal 0,
therefore we can substitute -> r = p/q where p and q is an integer and q does not euql to 0
Thus the statement is a rational number and satisfies the form (b - a) / (ab^2) = p/q

10 Assume that m and n are both integers and that n does not equal to 0.
Explain why (5m-12n)/(4n) must be a rational number.
Suppose m and n are any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer whre both does not equal to 0 [we must show that (5m-12n)/(4n) is a rational nubmer]

m = n = does not equal to 0
(5m-12n)/(4n)

let p = 5m-12n. Since any integer minus any integer p is also an integer
let q = 4n. 4 times any nonzero integer is an integer.
Additionally, since n does not eual to 0, we know 4n does not equal to 0, so q does not equal to 0

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q does not equal to 0
Therefore, since (5m-12n)/(4n) satisfies this form, it must be a rational nujmber


11. Prove that every integer is a rational number
Suppose n is any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer [we must show that n is a rational number]

By the definiton of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as p/q
where p and q are integers and q does not equal to 0

We can write every integer in this form: n = n/1 where n is an integer and 1 is a nonzero integer.
Since this satisfies the definition of a rational number, every integer is rational.
therefore it is true [as was to be shown]

12. Let S be the statement
“The square of any rational number is rational.”
A formal version of S is “For every rational number r, r^2 is rational.”
Fill in the blanks in the proof for S.

Proof: suppose that r is (a). by the definition of rational, r = a/b for some (b)
with b does not equal 0. By substitution, r = (c) = a^2/b^2
Since a and b are both integers, so are the products a^2 and (d). also b^2 does not equal 0 by the (e)
hence r^2 is a ratio of two integers with a nonzero denominator and so (f) by htedefinition of rational

answer: 
a. a rational number
b. integer a and b
c. (a/b)^2
d. b^2
e. nonzero property
f. r^2

13. Consider the following statement: The negative of any rational number is rational
a. Write the statement formally using a quantifier and a variable.
answer: Ax number x, if x is rational, then -x is rational

b. Determine whether the statement is true or false and justify your answer. 
answer:
suppose x is any particular but arbitrarly chosen rational number [we must show that -x is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b
x = a/b
-x = -(a/b)

Since a is still integer (because negative integer is still integer) and b is also still integer (same reason).
Additionally, b is nonzero and therefore this fits the definition of rational number

14. consider the statement: the cube of any rational number is a rational number
a. write the statement formally using a quantifier and variable
answwer: Ax number x,  if is rational then x^3 is rational number 

b.determine wheter the statement is true or false and justify your answer
answer:
suppose x is any particular but arbitrarily chosen rational number [we must show that x^3 is rational]
By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b

x^3
= (a/b)^3
= a^3/b^3

A is an integer because the product of integers is still integer
B is an integer because the product of integers is still integer
Additionally, b is also non zero. Therefore, by the defitnition of rational number, x^3 fits the form and it is a rational number

Determine which of the statements in 15–19 are true 
and which are false. prove each true statement directly 
from the definitions, and give a counterexample for each 
false statement. For a statement that is false, determine 
whether a small change would make it true. If so, make 
the change and prove the new statement. Follow the 
directions for writing proofs on page 173.

15. the product of any two rational numbers is a rational number
Theorem: Ax number x, Ax number y, if x and y is rational, x * y is rational

Proof:
Suppose x and y are arbitrarily chosen rational number. [we must show that x * y is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as x = a/b
Where a and b is any integer and b does not equal to zero

Let x = p/q where p and q is integer and q is nonzero 
let y = r/s where r and s in integer and s is nonzero

Then we can substitute
p/q * r/s
= pr/qs

let k = pr. pr is an integer because any integer times any integer is integer. therefore k is an integer
let m = qs. qs is an integer because any integer times any integer is integer.
Additionally , q s is also nonzero
Then by the defitnition of rational number, k/m is a rational
Threfore x * y is rational

16. The quotient of any two rational numbers is a rational number.
Ax number a and b, if a and b is rational, a/b is rational
suppose a and b is any particular but arbitrary chosen rational number. [we must show that a/b is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a rational number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b are integers and b doe snot equal 0

let a = p/q where p and q are both integers and q does not equal to 0
let b = r/s where r and s are both integers and s does not equal to 0

then we can substitute
(p/q) / (r/s)
= p/q . s/r
= ps/qr

let k = ps. since any integer times integer is an integer, ps is an integer, therefore, k is an integer
let m = qr. since any integer times integer is an integer, qr is an integer, therefore, m is an integer
additionally, qr does noe equal to 0, therefore m does not equal to 0
Then by the definition of rational number, k/m is rational and therefore a/b is rational. [as was shown] 


17. The difference of any two rational numbers is a rational number.
Ax number a and b, if a anb b is rational, a - b is rational
suppose a and b are any particular rational number [we must show a - b is rational]

By the definition of rational number, a rational number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b are integers and b doe snot equal 0

let a = p/q where p and q are both integers and q does not equal to 0
let b = r/s where r and s are both integers and s does not equal to 0
Then we can substitute
(p/q)-(r/s)
= ps-rq/qs

let k = ps-rq. since any integer times integer minus integer is an integer, ps-rq is an integer, therefore k is an integer
let m = qs. since any integer times integer is an integer, qr is an integer, therefore, m is an integer
additionally, qs does noe equal to 0, therefore m does not equal to 0
Then by the definition of rational number, k/m is rational and therefore a-b is rational.

18. If r and s are any two rational numbers, then r + s / 2 is rational.
Ax number s and r, if s and r is rational, then r + s /2 is rational

Suppose s and r are any parciular rational number [we must show that r + s / 2 is rational]
By the definition of rational number, a rational number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b are integers and b doe snot equal 0

let s = a/b where a and b are both integers and b does not equal to 0
let r = c/d where c and d are both integers and d does not equal to 0
Then we can substitute

r + s / 2
= (a/b + c/d) / 2
= (ad + cb / bd) / 2
= ad + cb / 2bd

let k = (ad + cb). since any integer times integer plus integer is an integer, ad+cb is an integer, therefore k is an integer
let m = 2nd. since any integer times 2 is an integer, 2bd is an integer, therefore, m is an integer
additionally, 2bd does noe equal to 0, therefore m does not equal to 0
Then by the definition of rational number, ad + cb / 2bd is rational and therefore r + s / 2 is rational.

19. for all real numbers a and b, if a < b then a < ((a + b) / 2)  < b
(You may use the properties of inequalities in T17–T27 of Appendix A.)
Ax real number a and b, if a < b then (a < (a + b) < b)

Suppose a and b are any particular real number [we must show that if a < b then (a < (a + b) < b)]
First, we must show that a < (a + b) / 2
= 2a < a + b
= a < (a + b) / 2

Second, we must show that (a + b) / 2 < b
= a + b < 2b
= (a + b) / 2 < b

Since we have shown that a < (a + b) / 2 and (a + b) / 2 < b, the statement is proven

20. Use the results of exercises 18 and 19 to prove that given any two rational numbers r and s with r < s there is another rational number between r and s.
An important consequence is that there are infinitely many rational numbers in between any two distinct rational numbers.
See Section 7.4.

From exercise 18 -  If r and s are any two rational numbers, then r + s / 2 is rational.
Ax number s and r, if s and r is rational, then r + s /2 is rational

Given any two rational numbers r and s, there is another rational number between r and s.
Since we know that r + s / 2 is rational from exercise 18
and r < r + 2 / 2 < s from exercise 19, we cna conclude that thre is always a rational number between any two rational numbers
By repeatedly applying this process (taking midpoints again and again), we can generate infinitely many rational numbers between any two distinct rational numbers.

Use the properties of even and odd integers that are

which properties you use to justify your reasoning.

Example 4.3.3 Deriving Additional Results about Even and Odd Integers
 Suppose that you have already proved the following properties of even and odd integers:
 1. The sum, product, and difference of any two even integers are even.
 2. The sum and difference of any two odd integers are even.
 3. The product of any two odd integers is odd.

 4. The product of any even integer and any odd integer is even.

 5. The sum of any odd integer and any even integer is odd.

 6. The difference of any odd integer minus any even integer is odd.
 7. The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd.
 ========

21. True or false? If m is any even integer and n is any odd integer, then m^2 + 3n is odd. Explain
Ax integer m, Ax integer n, if m is even and n is odd -> m^2 + 3n is odd

m (even) ^ 2 (even) = even by property 1,
3 (odd). n (odd) = odd by propert 3
Therefore by using substitution
even + odd =  odd by property 5

22. True or false? if a is any odd integer, then a^2 + a is even. Explain
Ax integer a, if a is odd, then a^2 + a is even

a^2 = a . a = odd . odd = odd by property 3
a = odd by the given statement
therefore we can substitute -> odd + odd = even by property 2

23. True or false? if k is any even integer and m is any odd integer, then (k+2)^2 - (m-1)^2 is even. explain
Ax integer k, Ax integer m, if k is even and m is odd, (k+2)^2 - (m-1)^2 is even

First we must check each of the expression
(k + 2) ^ 2
= (even + even) . (even + even)
= even . even - by propert 1
= even - by property 1

(m - 1) ^ 2
= (odd - odd) . (odd - odd)
= even . even - by property 2
= even - by property 1

Then we can substitute back
even - even
= even - by property 1

Derive the statements in 24–26 as corollaries of theorems 4.3.1, 4.3.2,
and the results of exercises 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.
result of exercise 12: The square of any rational number is rational.
result of exercise 13: the negative of any rational number is rational
result of exercise 14: the cube of any rational number is rational
result of exercise 15: the product of any two rational numbers is a rational number
result of exercise 17: the diffrence of any two rational numbers is a rational number

theorems 4.3.1:  Every integer is a rational number.
theorem 4.3.2: The sum of any two rational numbers is rational

24. For any rational numbers r and s, 2r + 3s is rational
First, have to derive 2r and 3s
2r -> 2 (integer) times rational number
By theorem 4.3.1, 2 is also a rational number, then we can substitute
rational number . rational number
by result of exercise 15, we conclude that rational number times rational number is a rational number

Secondly, we must show that 3s is rational
3s -> 3 (integer) times rational number s
By theorem 4.3.1, 3 is also a rational number, then we can substitute
rational number . rational number
by result of exercise 15, we conclude that rational number times rational number is a rational number

Finally, we can put everything in
rational number + rational number
by theorem 4.3.2, rational number + rational number = rational number
[as was to be shown]

25. if r is any rational number, ten 3r^2 - 2r + 4 is rational
We have to derive and break down each expression
3r ^ 2
= 3 (integer) . r (rational) ^ 2
= rational (by theorem 4.3.1) . rational (by exercise 12)
= rational (by exercise 15)

2r + 4
= 2 (integer) . r (rational) + 4 (integer)
= (rational (by theorem 4.3.1) . rational) + rational (by theorem 4.3.1)
= rational (by exercise 15) + rational
= rational (by theorem 4.3.2)
Then we can plug in 3r^2 - 2r + 4
rational - rational
= rational (by exercise 17) [as was to be shown]

26. for any rational number s, 5s^3 + 8s^2 - 7 is rational
First we must evaluate each expression
5s^3
= 5 (integer) . s^3 (rational by exercise 14)
= rational (by theorem 4.3.1) . rational
= rational (by exercise 15)

8s^2 - 7
= 8 (rational by theorem 4.3.1 ). s^2 (rational by exercise 12) - 7 (rational by theorem 4.3.1)
= rational . rational - rational
= rational (by exercise 15) - rational
= rational (by exercise 17)

then we can plug in
3r^2 - 2r + 4
rational - rational
= rational (by exercise 17), as was to be shown

27. It is a fact that if n is any nonnegative integer, then
1 + 1/2 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 + ... = 1 - (1/2^n+1)/1-(1/2)

 (A more general form of this statement is proved in Section 5.2.)
 Is the right-hand side of this equation rational? If so, express it as a ratio of two integers.

 Let's analyze the right hand side.
by the definition of a rational number, a number is rational if it can eb written in r = a/b
where a and b is an integer and b does not equal 0

First let a =  1 - (1/2^n+1) / 1-(1/2)
first the denominator is 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 which is rational

now the rhs becomes
1 - (1/2^n+1)/ 1/2
= (2 . 1 - (1/2^n+1))
= 2 - 2(1/2^n+1)
= 2-1/2^n = 2^n+1 - 1 / 2n

since the numerator and denumoerator is integer and fits the definition of rational ,therefore its rational

28. Suppose a, b, c, and d are integers and a does not equal c.
Suppose also that x is a real number that satisfies the equation

ax + b / cx + d = 1, where a does not equal c

Must x be rational? If so, express x as a ratio of two integers.

ax + b / cx + d = 1
ax + b = cx + d
ax - cx = d - b
x(a - c) = d - b
x = d - b / a - c

Now let's determine if x is rational.
by the definition of rational number, a number is rational if it can be written as r = a/b where a and b is an integer
and b does not equal to 0. We can check the form

x = d - b / a - c
let p = d -b. since any integer minus any integer t is an integer
let q = a - c. since any integer minus any integer q is an integer.
additionaly, q does not equal 0 since a does not equal c.
therefore we can conclude that ax + b / cx + d = 1 is raitonal [as was to be shown]

29. Suppose a, b, and c are integers and x, y, and z are 
nonzero real numbers that satisfy the following 
equations:

a = xy / x + y
b = xz / x + z
c = yz / y + z

is x rational? if so, express it as ratio of two integers.

First we must solve for x for the first equation
a = xy / x + y
a (x + y) = xy
ax + ay = xy
ax - yx = -ay
x(a - y) = -ay
x = -ay / a-y
let p = -ay. We cannot guarantee that p is integer because y is nonzero real number 
let q = a - y.  we cannot guarantee that x is always rational because y is nonzero real numer.
therefore x might not be rational.

30. Prove that if one solution for a quadratic equation of
the form x^2 + bx + c = 0 is rational (where b and c are rational), then the other solution is also rational.
Use the fact that if the solutions of the equation are r and s, then x^2 + bx + c = (x - r)(x - s)


x^2 + bx + c = (x - r)(x - s)
x^2 + bx + c = x^2 - (r + s)x + rs

b = - (r+s)  = -r-s
c = rs 

Since we know that b is rational and r is rational, their sum must also be rational
as to be shown

31.  Prove that if a real number c satisfies a polynomial equation of the form

r3x^3 + r2x^2 + r1x + r0 = 0

where r0, r1, r2, and r3 are rational numbers then c satisfies an equation of the form

n3x^3 + n2x^2 + n1x + n0 = 0

where n0, n1, n2, and n3 are integers
definition: a number c is called a root of a polynomial p(x) if and only if p(c) = 0

answer:
since ri is rational, we can write ri as the following form: ri = ai / bi where i is the index
and ai and bi are both integers and bi does not equal 0, then we can substitute

(a3/b3)x^3 + (a2/b2)x^2 + (a1/b1)x + (a0/b0) = 0
let B =  the LCM of (b3, b2, b1, and b0)
B . (a3/b3)x^3 + (a2/b2)x^2 + (a1/b1)x + (a0/b0) = B .0
= a3^3 + a2^2 + a1x + a0
Thus, we have shown that it satisfies equation with raitonal coefficient it also satisfies polynomial

32. Prove that every rational number c, if c is the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients,
then c is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients.

answer: similar to exercise 31

 33. when expressions of the form (x - r)(x - s) are multiplied out, a quadratic polynomial is obtained.
 For instance, (x-2)(x-(-7)) = (x-2)(x+7) = x^2 + 5x - 14

 a. What can be said about the coefficients of 
the polynomial obtained by multiplying out 
(x-r)(x-s) when both r and s are odd integers? 
When both r and s are even integers? When one 
of r and s is even and the other is odd?

First, expand (x-r) (x-s)

= x^2 - x(s + r) + rs

Let's analyze r + s and rs
r + s -> if both r and s is even, then this is even by property 1
r + s -> if both r and s is odd, then this is even by property 2
r + s -> if one of them is even and one of them is odd, then it's odd by property 5

Now on to rs

r . s -> if both r and s is odd, then this is even by property 3
r . s -> if one of them is even and one of them is odd, then it's odd by property 4

b. it follows from part a that x^2 - 1253x + 255 cannot be written as a product of two polynomials

In 35–39 find the mistakes in the “proofs” that the sum of any two rational numbers is a rational number

Proof: Any two rational numbers produce a rational number when added together.
So if r and s are particular but arbitrarily chosen rational numbers, then r + s is rational.

answer: here the proof is the same as saying the sum of two rational number is rational
The mistake is just assuming and jumps to r + s is rational without even proving what defines a rational number
e.g the quotient of integers a/b where a and b is integer and b does not equal 0 

36. Proof: Let rational numbers r = 1/4 and s=1/2 be given
Then r + s = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4, which is a rational number. This is what was to be shown
answer: this proof just calculates two specific rational numbers without proving that the sum of ANY two rational number is rational
This only proof only takes a specific value (1/4 and 1/2) instead of proving wheter it applies to any two rational numbers

37. “Proof: Suppose r and s are rational numbers.
By definition of rational, r = a/b for some integers 
a and b with b does not equal 0,
and s = a/b for some integers a and b with b does not equal 0. Then

r + s = a/b + a/b = 2a/b
Let p = a. Then p is an integer since it is a product of integers.
Hence r + s = p/b, where p and b  are integers and b does not equal 0.
Thus r+s is a rational number by definition of rational. This is what was to be shown.

answer: the mistake here is defining the same variable for r and s (they are both a and b)
It should have a different variable because were' comparing different value for diffrent rational 

38. Proof: Suppose r and s are rational numbers. 
Then r = a/b and s = c/d for some integers a, b, c, and d with b does not equal 0 and d does not equal 0
(by definition of rational). Then

r + s = a/b + c/d
But this is a sum of two fractions, which is a fraction.
So r-s is a rational number since a rational number is a fraction.

answer: the mistake here is assuming that a rational number is a fraction instead of proving that it has the form of a rational number
Also, the euqation isn't completely finished and can be solved further

39. Proof: Suppose r and s are rational numbers. 
If r + s is rational, then by definition of rational r + s = a/b for some integers a and b with b does not equal 0.
Also since r and s are rational, r = i/j and s = m/n for some integers i, j, m, and n
with j does not equal 0 and n does not equal 0. It follows that

r + s = i/j + m/n = a/b

which is a quotient of two integers with a nonzero denominator. Hence it is a national number This is what is to be shown
answer: this proof mistakenly assume that i/j + m/n = a/b without evaluating the actual equation (eg jn denominator), learind to a mistake.
