1. in a proof by strong mathematical induction the basis step may require checking a property P(n) for more
__ value of n
answer: than one

2. Suppose that in the basis step for a proof by strong 
mathematical induction the property P(n) was 
checked for every integer n from a through b. 
Then in the inductive step one assumes that for 
any integer k >= b, the property P(n) is true for 
all values of i from ____ through ____ and one shows that ___ is true.
answer: a through k, p(k+1)

3. According to the well-ordering principle for the 
integers, if a set S of integers contains at least 
_____ and if there is some integer that is less than
or equal to every ______, then _____
answer: one integer, integer in S, S contains a least element

Exercise set 5.4
1. suppose a1, a2, a3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
a = 1, a2 = 3
ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1 for each integer k>=3
prove that an is odd for every integer n>=1 

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 1, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that p(1) and p(2) are true 

p(n) -> an is odd
p(1) -> is 1 odd? true
p(2)-> is 3 odd? true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume a1,a2,...,ak are all odd
we must show ak+1 is odd


ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1
a(k+1) = a(k+1)-2 + 2a(k+1)-1
a(k+1) = a(k-1) + 2ak

since we know that ai through ak is odd, we can substitute
odd + even . odd
odd + even
= odd

therefore a+1 is odd
