Exercise set 5.4
1. suppose a1, a2, a3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
a = 1, a2 = 3
ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1 for each integer k>=3
prove that an is odd for every integer n>=1 

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 1, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that p(1) and p(2) are true 

p(n) -> an is odd
p(1) -> is 1 odd? true
p(2)-> is 3 odd? true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume a1,a2,...,ak are all odd
we must show ak+1 is odd


ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1
a(k+1) = a(k+1)-2 + 2a(k+1)-1
a(k+1) = a(k-1) + 2ak

since we know that ai through ak is odd, we can substitute
odd + even . odd
odd + even
= odd

therefore a+1 is odd

2. suppose b1, b2, b3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
b1 = 4, b2 = 12,
bk = bk-2 + bk-1 for each integer k>=3

prove that bn is divisible by 4 for every integer n>= 1

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 4, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1)
p(n) -> bn is divisible by 4
p0 -> 4 is divisible by 4 = true
p1 ->  12 is divisibel by 4 = true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume a1,a2,...,ak are all divisible by 4
we must show ak+1 is divisible by 4

bk = bk-2 + bk-1
b(k+1) = b(k+1-2) + b(k+1-1)
b(k+1) = b(k-1) + bk

by the definition of divisibility, a number is divisible it can be written as b = dq for some integer q
since we know from IH that i thorugh k is divisibel by 4, then we can substitute
= 4q + 4r
= 4(q+r) where (q+r) is some integer, which fits the form 4 . some integer

3. suppose c1, c2, c3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
c0 = 2, c1 = 2, c2 = 6
ck = 3ck-3 for every integer k>=3
prove that cn is even for each integer n >= 0

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 0, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1) and p(2)
p(n) -> cn is even
c0 -> 2 is even? true
c1 -> 2 is even? true
c2 -> 6 is even? true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume c1,c2,...,ck are all even
we must show ck+1 is even

ck = 3ck-3 
c(k+1) = 3c(k+1-3)
= 3c(k-2)
since we know from the inductive step that ci through ck are all evne, we can substitute
= odd . even
= even

therefore it is true

4. suppose d1, d2, d3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
d1 = 9/10, d2 = 10/11

dk = dk-1 . dk-2 for every integer k>=3

prove that 0 < dn <= 1 for each integer n>=1

answer: 
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 1, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true 
p(n) -> 0 < dn <= 1
d1 -> 0 < 9/10 <= 1 = true
d2 => 0 < 10/10 <=1 = true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume d1,d2,...,dk is 0 < dn <= 1
we must show dk+1 is 0 < d(k+1) <= 1

dk = dk-1 . dk-2 
d(k+1) = d(k+1-1) . d(k+1-2)
d(k+1) = dk . d(k-1)
since we know from IH that all values od 1 through k is is 0 < di <= 1

0 < dk <= 1 - this is true from IH
0 < dk-1 <= 1 - true
therefore the two are between 0 and 1
since we know that multiplying two number between 0 (excluded) and 1 (included)
will still be less than or equal to 1 but greater than 0, therefore it is true


5. suppose e1, e2, e3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
e0 = 12, e1 = 29
ek = 5e(k-1) - 6e(k-2) for each integer k>=2

prove that en = 5 . 3^n + 7.2^n for each integer n>=0

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1)
p(n) -> en = 5 . 3^n + 7.2^n
p0 -> e(0) = 5 . 3^0 + 7.2^0 = 5 . 1 + 7.1 = 12
p1 -> e(1) = 5 . 3^1 + 7.2^1 = 5 . 3 + 7.2 = 15 + 14 = 29
therefore the base case is true


step 2:
IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume e1,e2,...,ek is true
we must show e(k+1) is true

ek = 5e(k-1) - 6e(k-2) 
e(k+1) = 5e(k+1-1) - 6e(k+1-2)
e(k+1) = 5ek - 6e(k-1)

since we know from IH that the formula holds we can substitute
= 5(5 . 3^k + 7.2^k) - 6( 5 . 3^k-1 + 7.2^k-1 )
= (25.3^k - 30.k^k-1) = 5.3^k+1

(35.2^k - 42.2^k-1)
= 7.2^k+1
= (5.3^k+1) + (7.2^k+1)

therefore the equation holds

6. suppose f1, f2, f3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
f0 = 5, f1 = 16,
fk = 7f(k-1) - 10f(k-2) for every integer k>=2

prove that fn = 3.2^n + 2.5^n for each integer n>=0

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 0, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1)
p(n) -> fn = 3.2^n + 2.5^n
p0 -> f(0) = 3.2^n + 2.5^n
p1 -> f(1) = 3.2^n + 2.5^n
