1. in a proof by strong mathematical induction the basis step may require checking a property P(n) for more
__ value of n
answer: 

2. Suppose that in the basis step for a proof by strong 
mathematical induction the property P(n) was 
checked for every integer n from a through b. 
Then in the inductive step one assumes that for 
any integer k >= b, the property P(n) is true for 
all values of i from ____ through ____ and one shows that ___ is true.
answer:

3. According to the well-ordering principle for the 
integers, if a set S of integers contains at least 
_____ and if there is some integer that is less than
or equal to every ______, then _____
