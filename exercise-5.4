Exercise set 5.4
1. suppose a1, a2, a3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
a = 1, a2 = 3
ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1 for each integer k>=3
prove that an is odd for every integer n>=1 

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 1, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that p(1) and p(2) are true 

p(n) -> an is odd
p(1) -> is 1 odd? true
p(2)-> is 3 odd? true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume a1,a2,...,ak are all odd
we must show ak+1 is odd


ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1
a(k+1) = a(k+1)-2 + 2a(k+1)-1
a(k+1) = a(k-1) + 2ak

since we know that ai through ak is odd, we can substitute
odd + even . odd
odd + even
= odd

therefore a+1 is odd

2. suppose b1, b2, b3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
b1 = 4, b2 = 12,
bk = bk-2 + bk-1 for each integer k>=3

prove that bn is divisible by 4 for every integer n>= 1

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 4, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1)
p(n) -> bn is divisible by 4
p0 -> 4 is divisible by 4 = true
p1 ->  12 is divisibel by 4 = true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume a1,a2,...,ak are all divisible by 4
we must show ak+1 is divisible by 4

bk = bk-2 + bk-1
b(k+1) = b(k+1-2) + b(k+1-1)
b(k+1) = b(k-1) + bk

by the definition of divisibility, a number is divisible it can be written as b = dq for some integer q
since we know from IH that i thorugh k is divisibel by 4, then we can substitute
= 4q + 4r
= 4(q+r) where (q+r) is some integer, which fits the form 4 . some integer

3. suppose c1, c2, c3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
c0 = 2, c1 = 2, c2 = 6
ck = 3ck-3 for every integer k>=3
prove that cn is even for each integer n >= 0

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 0, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1) and p(2)
p(n) -> cn is even
c0 -> 2 is even? true
c1 -> 2 is even? true
c2 -> 6 is even? true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume c1,c2,...,ck are all even
we must show ck+1 is even

ck = 3ck-3 
c(k+1) = 3c(k+1-3)
= 3c(k-2)
since we know from the inductive step that ci through ck are all evne, we can substitute
= odd . even
= even

therefore it is true

4. suppose d1, d2, d3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
d1 = 9/10, d2 = 10/11

dk = dk-1 . dk-2 for every integer k>=3

prove that 0 < dn <= 1 for each integer n>=1

answer: 
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 1, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true 
p(n) -> 0 < dn <= 1
d1 -> 0 < 9/10 <= 1 = true
d2 => 0 < 10/10 <=1 = true
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume d1,d2,...,dk is 0 < dn <= 1
we must show dk+1 is 0 < d(k+1) <= 1

dk = dk-1 . dk-2 
d(k+1) = d(k+1-1) . d(k+1-2)
d(k+1) = dk . d(k-1)
since we know from IH that all values od 1 through k is is 0 < di <= 1

0 < dk <= 1 - this is true from IH
0 < dk-1 <= 1 - true
therefore the two are between 0 and 1
since we know that multiplying two number between 0 (excluded) and 1 (included)
will still be less than or equal to 1 but greater than 0, therefore it is true


5. suppose e1, e2, e3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
e0 = 12, e1 = 29
ek = 5e(k-1) - 6e(k-2) for each integer k>=2

prove that en = 5 . 3^n + 7.2^n for each integer n>=0

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1)
p(n) -> en = 5 . 3^n + 7.2^n
p0 -> e(0) = 5 . 3^0 + 7.2^0 = 5 . 1 + 7.1 = 12
p1 -> e(1) = 5 . 3^1 + 7.2^1 = 5 . 3 + 7.2 = 15 + 14 = 29
therefore the base case is true


step 2:
IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume e1,e2,...,ek is true
we must show e(k+1) is true

ek = 5e(k-1) - 6e(k-2) 
e(k+1) = 5e(k+1-1) - 6e(k+1-2)
e(k+1) = 5ek - 6e(k-1)

since we know from IH that the formula holds we can substitute
= 5(5 . 3^k + 7.2^k) - 6( 5 . 3^k-1 + 7.2^k-1 )
= (25.3^k - 30.k^k-1) = 5.3^k+1

(35.2^k - 42.2^k-1)
= 7.2^k+1
= (5.3^k+1) + (7.2^k+1)

therefore the equation holds

6. suppose f1, f2, f3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
f0 = 5, f1 = 16,
fk = 7f(k-1) - 10f(k-2) for every integer k>=2

prove that fn = 3.2^n + 2.5^n for each integer n>=0

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 0, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1)
p(n) -> fn = 3.2^n + 2.5^n
p0 -> f(0) = 3.2^0 + 2.5^0 = 3.1 + 2.1 = 5
p1 -> f(1) = 3.2^1 + 2.5^1 = 3.2 + 2.5 = 6+10=16
threfore the base cases are true


step 2:
IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 0 <= i <= k
in other words, assume f1,f2,...,fk the equation fn = 3.2^n + 2.5^n holds
we must show fk+1 is true

f(k+1) = 7f(k+1-1) - 10f(k+1-2)
f(k+1) = 7fk - 10f(k-1)

since we know from IH that the values from 1 through k the equation holds we can subsittute

fk = 3.2^k + 2.5^k
f(k-1) = 3.2^(k-1) + 2.5^(k-1)

= 7 . (3.2^k + 2.5^k) - 10 . (3.2^(k-1) + 2.5^(k-1))
= (3.2^k+1) + (2.5^(k+1))

therefore the equation holds

7. suppose g1, g2, g3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
g1 = 3, g2 = 5,
gk = 3g(k-1) - 2g(k-2) for each integer k>=3

prove that gn = 2^n + 1 for every integer n>= 1


answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 1, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(1) and p(2)
p(n) ->  gn = 2^n + 1 
p1 ->  g1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3 
p2 ->   g2 = 2^2 + 1  = 5 
therefore the base case is true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 1 <= i <= k
in other words, assume g1,g2,...,gk the equation gn = 2^n + 1 holds
we must show gk+1 is true

g(k+1) = 3g(k+1-1) - 2g(k+1-2)
g(k+1) = 3gk - 2g(k-2)

since we know from IH that the equation holds for gi = 2^i + 1 we can substitute

gk -> 2^k + 1
g(k-2) -> 2^(k-2) + 1

= 3 . (2^k + 1) - 2 . (2^(k-2) + 1)
= 3.2^k + 3 - 2.2^(k-2)+2
= (3.2^k - 2.2^k-2) - 1
= 2^k+1 + 1

therefore the equation holds

8. suppose h1, h2, h3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
h0 = 1, h1 = 2, h2 = 3
hk = h(k-1) + h(k-2) + h(k-3) for each integer k>=3 

prove that hn <= 3^n for every integer n>= 0

answer:
We will use strong mathematical induction to prove that for every integer n >= 0, 
P(n) is true.

step 1: show that the base case are true  p(0) and p(1) and p(2)
p(n) -> hn <= 3^n
p0 -> h0 <= 3^0 = 1 <= 1 = true
p1 ->  h1 <= 3^1 = 2 <= 3 = true
p2 -> h2 <= 3^2 = 3 <= 6 = true
therefore the base cases are true

step 2: let k be any integer with k>=2 (starting value since k+1 >= 3)

IH: assume that p(i) is true for each integer i such that 0 <= i <= k
in other words, assume h1,h2,...,hk the formula hk <= 3^k holds
we must show hk+1 is true

h(k+1) = h(k+1-1) + h(k+1-2) + h(k+1-3)
h(k+1) = hk + h(k-1) + h(k-2)

since we know from IH that the value from 0 to k, the formula holds we can substitute

hk <= 3^k
h(k-1) <= 3^(k-1)
h(k-2) <= 3^(k-2)

h(k+1) <= 3^k +3^k-1 + 3^k-2
h(k+1) <= (3^2 . 3^k-2) + (3^1 . 3^(k-2)) + 3^k-2
h(k+1) <= 3^k-2 (3^2 + 3^1 + 1)
h(k+1) <= 3^k-2 . 13

13 . 3^k-2 <= 3^k+1
13 <= 27
threfore the statment is true

11.
a step is when you take two seperate blocks and connect them together to form one larger blocks

p(n) = for every integer n>=1, the number of steps required to put together all n pieces of jigsaw puzzle is n-1
we must show that this is true by mathematical induction

base case -> n = 1
p(1) = 1 - 1 = 0 steps
p(2) = 2 - 1 = 1 steps
p(3) = 3 - 1 = 2 steps
p(4) = 4 - 1 = 3 steps

each step reduces the number of seperate blocks by one
IH = assume that for some integer k>=1, p(i) is true for all integers i such that 1 <= i <= k
Assume that for any number of pieces i from 1 up to k, it takes i - 1 steps to assemble those i pieces into a single block

We must show that p(k+1) is true
consider a k+1 puzzle piece
the last step in assembling these k+1 pieces must involve fitting together two blocks

two blocks = x and y where x and y are >= 1
when these two blocks form together, they must form k + 1 pieces

so x + y = k + 1
x = k + 1 - y -> x = k + 1 - 1 -> x <= k
y = k + 1 - x -> y = k + 1 - 1 -> y <= k

apply IH
to assemble the block of x pieces, it took x - 1 steps because 1 <= x <= k
to assemble the block of x pieces, it took y - 1 steps because 1 <= y <= k

the total steps = num of steps for x blocks + num of steps for y blocks + final step wher you combine all
= (x-1) + (y-1) + 1
= x + y - 1
= (k+1) - 1 = k
therefore the statement is true


12. p(n) -> For a circular track with n cans of gasoline, where the total amount of
gasoline is sufficient to enable a certain car to make one complete circuit of the track,
it is possible to find an initial location for placing the car so that it will be able to traverse
the entire track by using the various amounts of gasoline in the cans that it encounters along the way
n>=1

base case p(1) -> consider a circular track with n = 1 gasoline
; the problem stats the total amoun required to complte a full circuit is 1 gasoline
threfore the car can fill out the gasoline anr run 1 complte circuit without running out of fuel
p(1 is true)

IH: Assume that p(k) is true

15. 
p(n) = "Any sum of n even integers is an even integer."
we want to prove pn is true for all integers n>= 1

base case: n = 1
Any sum of 1 even integers is an even integer.
true because any even integer itself is that even integer itself

IH: assume that for some arbitrary integer k>= 1 , p(i) is true for all integers i such that
1 <= i <= k. in other words, assume that sum of i even integersis even from i up to k

we must show that p(k+1) is true
any sum of (k+1) even integers is an even integers

a integer is even if it  can be written as 2q for some integer q
consider an arbitrary sum of k+1 even itnegers like
s(k+1) = e1, e2, e3, e4 ... e(k+1) where each ej is an even integer
since k>=1 we know that 1 <= k <= k
therefore from IH we know that the sum up to k is even integers

now the full sum
s(k+1) =   ek + e(k+1)
we know that ek is even, and ek+1 is an even integer by definition
s(k+1) = 2q + 2r
= 2(q+r)
thus the sum of the two is always even since even + even = even by parity rules

16. Use strong mathematical induction to prove that 
for every integer n >= 2, if n is even, then any sum
 of n odd integers is even, and if n is odd, then any 
sum of n odd integers is odd.

p(n) = If n is even, then any sum  of n odd integers is even, and if n is odd,
then any sum of n odd integers is odd.
we want to prove pn is true for all integers n>= 2

base case: n = 2
p(2) -> If 2 is even, then any sum  of 2 odd integers is even, and if 2 is odd,
then any sum of 2 odd integers is odd.

is 2 even? true
then any sum  of 2 odd integers is even -> true because odd + odd is even by parity rule

is 2 odd? false
then any sum of 2 odd integers is odd. -> false
therefore the base case is true

IH -> assume that for some arbitrary integer k>=2, p(i) is true for all integer 2 <= i <= k
that is, assume that:
If i is even (for 2≤i≤k), then any sum of i odd integers is even.
If i is odd (for 2≤i≤k), then any sum of i odd integers is odd.

case1: k+1 is even, then any sum of k+1 odd integers is even

    
case1: k+1 is even, then any sum of k+1 odd integers is odd
