1. in a proof by strong mathematical induction the basis step may require checking a property P(n) for more
__ value of n
answer: than one

2. Suppose that in the basis step for a proof by strong 
mathematical induction the property P(n) was 
checked for every integer n from a through b. 
Then in the inductive step one assumes that for 
any integer k >= b, the property P(n) is true for 
all values of i from ____ through ____ and one shows that ___ is true.
answer: a through k, p(k+1)

3. According to the well-ordering principle for the 
integers, if a set S of integers contains at least 
_____ and if there is some integer that is less than
or equal to every ______, then _____
answer: one integer, integer in S, S contains a least element

Exercise set 5.4
1. suppose a1, a2, a3, ... is a sequence defined as follows
a = 1, a2 = 3
ak = ak-2 + 2ak-1 for each integer k>=3
prove that an is odd for every integer n>=1

answer:
base case: show that p(3) and p(4) are true 

a3 = a(k-2) + 2a(k-1) = a1 + 2 . a2
