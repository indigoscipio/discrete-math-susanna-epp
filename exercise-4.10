1. when an algorithm statement of the form x:=e is executed, ___
answer: variable x is assigned with the value of executed

2. consider an algorithm statement of the following form:

if (cond)
then s1
else s2

when such a statement is executed, the truth or falsity of the condition is evaluatd.
if condition is true ___
if the condition is false, ___

answer: s1 is evaluated, s2 is evaluated

3. consider an algorithm  statement of the following
while (condition)
[loop body]
end while

when such a statement is executed, the truth or falsity of the condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true -__, if the condition is false, ___
answer: loop body is executed, loop ends

4. Consider an algorithm statement of the following form.

for variable :=initial expression to final expression.
  [statements that make up the body of the loop]
  next (same) variable 

When such a statement is executed, variable is set 
equal to the value of the initial expression, and a 
check is made to determine whether the value of 
variable is less than or equal to the value of final 
expression. If so, ___ . If not, ___ .
answer: loop body is run, loop ends

5. given a nonnegatiev integer a and positive integer d the division algorithm computes
answer: the quotient q 
keep dividing a by d until the remainder is less than or equal to d
returns the final quotient and the remainder

6. given integers a and b, not both zero, gcd(a,b) is the integer d that satisfies the following two conditions;
0 <= r <= d and b = dq + r

7. if r is a positive intger, then gcd(r,0) is r

8. if a and b are integers not both zero and if q and r are nonnegative integeres such that a = bq + r, then
gcd (a,b) = gcd(b,r)

9. given the positive integers a and b with a > b, the euclidian algorithm computes
the GCD of A,B
