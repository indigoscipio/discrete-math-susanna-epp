1. when an algorithm statement of the form x:=e is executed, ___
answer: variable x is assigned with the value of e, the value is stored in the emory location

2. consider an algorithm statement of the following form:

if (cond)
then s1
else s2

when such a statement is executed, the truth or falsity of the condition is evaluatd.
if condition is true ___
if the condition is false, ___

answer: s1 is evaluated, s2 is evaluated

3. consider an algorithm  statement of the following
while (condition)
[loop body]
end while

when such a statement is executed, the truth or falsity of the condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true -__, if the condition is false, ___
answer: loop body is executed in order, go to next cond statement

4. Consider an algorithm statement of the following form.

for variable :=initial expression to final expression.
  [statements that make up the body of the loop]
  next (same) variable 

When such a statement is executed, variable is set 
equal to the value of the initial expression, and a 
check is made to determine whether the value of 
variable is less than or equal to the value of final 
expression. If so, ___ . If not, ___ .
answer: loop body is run and variable is increased by 1 until it reaches final expression, loop ends

5. given a nonnegatiev integer a and positive integer d the division algorithm computes
q and r with n = dq + r and 0 <= r < d
answer: the quotient q 
keep dividing a by d until the remainder is less than or equal to d
returns the final quotient and the remainder

6. given integers a and b, not both zero, gcd(a,b) is the integer d that satisfies the following two conditions;
d divides a, d divides b, there is a common divisor c where c <= d and c | a and c | b

7. if r is a positive intger, then gcd(r,0) is r

8. if a and b are integers not both zero and if q and r are nonnegative integeres such that a = bq + r, then
gcd (a,b) = gcd(b,r)

9. given the positive integers a and b with a > b, the euclidian algorithm computes
the GCD of A,B 

find the value of z when each of the algorithm segments in 1 and 2 is executed

1.
i:=2
if (i > 3 or i <= 0)
then z:= 1
else z:= 0

answer:
first assignment, i = 2
check if (2 > 3 (f) or 2 <= 0 (f)) - evaluates to false
z = 0 is executed, therefore z = 0

2.
i:=3
if(i<=3 or i>6)
then z:= 2
else z=0
answer:
initial variable assignment, i = 3
next check if (3<=3 (t) or 3>6 (f)) -> evaluates to true
z:=2 is executed - therefore z = 2

3. consider the following algorithm segment

if x . y > 0
then do
y := 3 . x
x := x + 1
end do
z = x . y

find the value of z if prior to execution x and y have the values given below
a. x = 2, y = 3, z = ??

answer:
check if 2 . 3 > 0 - true
y = 3.3 = 9
x = 2 + 1 = 3
z = 3 . 9 = 27
therefore z = 27

b. x = 1, y = 1
answer:
check if 1.1 > 0 - true
y = 3 .1 = 3
x = 1 + 1 = 2
z = 2 . 3 = 6
therefore z = 6


find the values of a and e after execution of the loops in 4 and 5 by first making trace tables for them

4.
a:=2
for i := 1 to 3
a:= 3a + 1
next i


Trace table
Iteration 0 (initial, before the loop runs)

Iteration 1

Iteration 2

5.
e:=2, f:=0
for k:=1 to 3
e:=e.k
f:= e+f
next k

make a trace table to trace the action of algorithm 4.10.1 for the input variables given in 6 and 7
