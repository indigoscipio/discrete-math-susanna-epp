exercise set 6.3
For each of 1–4 find a counterexample to show that the 
statement is false. Assume all sets are subsets of a univer
sal set U.

1. for all sets a,b, and c,
(A U B) A C = A U (B A C)

(A U B) A C  - an element is here if its in a or b and c
A U (B A C) - an element is here if its in a or if its both in b and c

let A = {1}
let B = {2,3}
let C = {3,4}

A U B = {1,2,3}
A U B A C = {3}

B∩C={2,3}∩{3,4}={3}

A∪(B∩C)={1}∪{3}={1,3}
since counterrexample is found tehrefore false

2. for all sets a and b, (A U B)^c = A^c U B^c
answer:

let the universal set U be {1,2,3}
let A = {1}
let B = {2}

LHS: (A U B)^c
this means an element is here if its not in A and not in B
A U B = 1,2
(A U B)^c = 3

RHS: A^c U B^c
this means an element is here if it's not in A or not in B
A^c = {2,3}
B^c = {1,3}
A^c U B^c = {1,2,3}

since RHS does not equal to RHS, therefore we found a counterexample and the statement is false


3. for all sets a,b,and c, if a is not a subset of b and b is not a subsetof c then
a is not a subset of c

premise
1. A is not a subset of B
2. B is not a subset of C


conclusoin
A is not a subset of C -> this means every element in A is not in C
to find a counterexample, we need to show that A is a subset of C

let A = {1}
let B = {2}
let C = {1,3}



4. for all sets A,B, and C, if B U C is a subset of A then
(A - B) A (A - C) = empty set
premise
B U C is a subset of A
this means every element in B or C is in A

conclusion
(A - B) A (A - C) = empty set
to find counterexample we need to find at least one elemnt in (A - B) and (A - C)

let A = {1,2,3}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

since we found a counterexample theefore the statement is false

For each of 5–21 prove each statement that is true and 
find a counterexample for each statement that is false. 
Assume all sets are subsets of a universal set U

5. for all sets A,B, and C
A - (B - C) = (A - B) - C

answer: is the statement true or false?
this seems like a simple commutative law for difference of sets so it must be true but I'm not sure

let A = {1,2,3}
let B = {2}
let C = {}

LHS -> A - (B - C)
an element is in this set if its in A AND if its not in (B - C) -> B^c or C^c
so x is in LHS if x is in A and (x is not in B or x is in C)


RHS -> (A - B) - C
an element is in this set if its in (A - B) and not in C
so x is in  RHS if its (x is in A and x is not in b) AND x is not in C
this means to find the counterexample we need to make LHS does not equal to RHS

let A = {1,2}
let B = {1}
let C = {2}

6. for all sets A and B, A A (A U B) = A

LFS -> A A (A U B)
this means:
x must be in A
x must be in A or B

LHS = A
this means x must be in A

to find a counterexample, we need to make LHS does not equal to RHS

let A = {1}
let B = {2}

LHS -> 1 A {1,2} = 1
RHS -> 1

not valid, need a different example
let A = {}
let B = {1}

seems to be true, but not sure. lets try to prove it
suppost a,b are any sets
we must show A A (A U B) = A, that is
we must show 2 things:
1) A A (A U B) is a subset of A
2) A is a subset of A (A U B)

part 1:
let x be any eleemnt in 
A A (A U B)
this means x is in a and
x is in A or B

since x is in a, therefore A A (A U B) is a subset of A

part 2:
A is a subset of A A (A U B)
A -> x is in A
(A U B) -> by thedefinition of union, x is in A or x is in B
since we know x is in A, therfore this is true
therefore the statment is true


7. for all sets A, B, and C,
(A - B) A (C - B) = A - (B U C)

LHS -> (A - B) A (C - B)
x is in A but not in B
and
x is in C but not in B

RHS -> A - (B U C)
x is in a
but not in (B or C)

to find a coutnerexample, we need to make LHS does not equal RHS

let A = {1,4}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

LHS -> (1,4 - 2) A (3 - 2) = {}

RHS -> 1,4 - 2,3 = 1,4

therfore counterexample found

8. for all sets A and B,
if A^c is a subset of B, then A U B = U

premise - what we know
A^c is a subset of B
this means every element not in A is in B

conclusion
A U B = U
a or b makes up the universal set

we need to show 2 things:
1 - A U B is a subset of U
2 - U is a subset of A U B

part 1: A U B is a subset of U
let x be an arbitrary element in the universal set U
case 1: x is in A
since x is in A therefore x E A U B by the definition of unio

case 2: x is not in A
since we know from the premise every element not in A is in B, then x is in B, therfore x E A U B

part 2: A U B is a subset of U
by the definition os universal set, this is always true.
therefore both statements are proven.


9. for all sets A,B, and C,
if A is a subset of C and B is a subset of C then A U B is a subset of C

premise - what we know
A is a subset of C and B is a subset of C
this means every element in A is in C
and
every element in B is in C

conclusion:
A U B is a subset of C
this means every eleemnt in A or B is in C

we must show the conclusion holds
A U B is a subset of C
case 1: x is in A
since we know that A is a subset of C from the premise, then x is in C 

A U B
case 2: x is in B
since we know that B is in C by from the premise, then x isi n C

10. for all sets A,B, if A is a subset of B,
then A A B^c = the empty set

premise - what we know
A is a subset of B
this means every element in A is in B

conclusion - what we need to prove
A A B^c = the empty set
this means A and not b contains no element

we must show the conclusion holds
A A B^c = the empty Set
suppose x is in A A B^c
this means x is in A and x is not in B
but we konw from the premise that every element in A is in B
so an element cannot be in B and not in B at the same time
therefore the supposition is false

11. for all sets a,b, and c, if A is a subset of B, then
A A (B A C)^c = the empty set

premise - what we know
 A is a subset of B
 this means eveyr element in A is in B

conclusion - what we need to prove
A A (B A C)^c = the empty set

suppose the opposite: suppose x is in
A A (B A C)^c
this means x is in A
and
x is not in both (B and C)
or by de margans law, this means x is not in B or x is not in C

let A = {1}
let A = {1,2}
let A = {2}


12. for all sets A,B,and C,
A A (B - C) = (A A B) - (A A C)

lets try some arbitrary example
A = {1,2}
B = {2}
C = {1,3}

LHS -> 1,2 A 2 = 2

RHS -> 2 - 1,3 = 2
seems to be true

general proof
we must show 2 things:
1. A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)
2. (A A B) - (A A C) is a subset of A A (B - C)

part 1: show that A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)
let x be any elemnt in A A (B - C)
we must show x is in (A A B) - (A A C)

premise:
A A (B - C)
by the definition of difference, x is not in C
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and B but not in C

(A A B) - (A A C)
(A A B)
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in B - satisfied as per premise
(A A C)
by thedefintion of intersect, x is in A and x is in C
since we know x is not in c, x cannot be in this intersect

part 2: (A A B) - (A A C) is a subset of A A (B - C)
premise: 
(A A B) - (A A C)
x E A and x E B
x is not in A A C

we need to show x is in A A (B - C)
A -> since we know x is in A, therfore this part is satisfied
for x to be in B - C, it must be in B and not in C. we know these facts from the premise
threfore satifisd

H 26. The following problem, devised by Ginger Bolton, appeared in the January 1989 issue of the College Mathematics Journal (Vol. 20, No. 1, p. 68):

Given a positive integer n ≥ 2, let S be the set of all nonempty subsets of {2, 3, …, n}. For each Sᵢ ∈ S, let Pᵢ be the product of the elements of Sᵢ. Prove or disprove that

Σ (i = 1 to 2ⁿ⁻¹) Pᵢ = ((n + 1)! / 2) − 1.

27. For all sets A, B, and C,
(A ∪ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C).

Proof: Suppose A, B, and C are any sets. Then
(A ∪ B) ∩ C = C ∩ (A ∪ B) (by commutativity)
= (C ∩ A) ∪ (C ∩ B) (by distributivity)
= (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) (by commutativity).

H 28. For all sets A, B, and C,
(A ∪ B) − (C − A) = A ∪ (B − C).

Proof: Suppose A, B, and C are any sets. Then
(A ∪ B) − (C − A) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (C − A)ᶜ (by set difference law)
= (A ∪ B) ∩ (C ∩ Aᶜ)ᶜ (by definition of difference)
= (A ∪ B) ∩ (Cᶜ ∪ A) (by De Morgan’s law)
= (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ Cᶜ)
= A ∪ (B ∩ Cᶜ)
= A ∪ (B − C).

H 29. Some steps are missing from the following proof:
For all sets A and B, (A ∪ B)ᶜ − Bᶜ = (A − B) ∪ Bᶜ.

Proof: Let any sets A and B be given. Then
(A ∪ B)ᶜ − Bᶜ = (A ∪ B)ᶜ ∩ (Bᶜ)ᶜ (by set difference law)
= (A ∪ B)ᶜ ∩ B (by double complement law)
= (Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ) ∩ B (by De Morgan’s law)
= Aᶜ ∩ (Bᶜ ∩ B) (by associativity)
= Aᶜ ∩ ∅ (by complement law)
= ∅.

Thus, (A ∪ B)ᶜ − Bᶜ = ∅.

30. For all sets A, B, and C,
(A ∩ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ C).

31. For all sets A and B,
A ∪ (B − A) = A ∪ B.

32. For all sets A and B,
(A ∪ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = A ∪ B.

A − (B − C) = (A − B) ∪ (A ∩ C).

35. For all sets A, B, and C,
