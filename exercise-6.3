Theorem 6.2.2
Theorem 6.2.2 – Properties of Set Operations

Commutative Laws:
- A ∪ B = B ∪ A
- A ∩ B = B ∩ A

Associative Laws:
- (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)
- (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)

Distributive Laws:
- A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
- A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

Identity Laws:
- A ∪ ∅ = A
- A ∩ U = A

Complement Laws:
- A ∪ Aᶜ = U
- A ∩ Aᶜ = ∅

Idempotent Laws:
- A ∪ A = A
- A ∩ A = A

De Morgan’s Laws:
- (A ∪ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∩ Bᶜ
- (A ∩ B)ᶜ = Aᶜ ∪ Bᶜ

exercise set 6.3
For each of 1–4 find a counterexample to show that the 
statement is false. Assume all sets are subsets of a univer
sal set U.

1. for all sets a,b, and c,
(A U B) A C = A U (B A C)

(A U B) A C  - an element is here if its in a or b and c
A U (B A C) - an element is here if its in a or if its both in b and c

let A = {1}
let B = {2,3}
let C = {3,4}

A U B = {1,2,3}
A U B A C = {3}

B∩C={2,3}∩{3,4}={3}

A∪(B∩C)={1}∪{3}={1,3}
since counterrexample is found tehrefore false

2. for all sets a and b, (A U B)^c = A^c U B^c
answer:

let the universal set U be {1,2,3}
let A = {1}
let B = {2}

LHS: (A U B)^c
this means an element is here if its not in A and not in B
A U B = 1,2
(A U B)^c = 3

RHS: A^c U B^c
this means an element is here if it's not in A or not in B
A^c = {2,3}
B^c = {1,3}
A^c U B^c = {1,2,3}

since RHS does not equal to RHS, therefore we found a counterexample and the statement is false


3. for all sets a,b,and c, if a is not a subset of b and b is not a subsetof c then
a is not a subset of c

premise
1. A is not a subset of B
2. B is not a subset of C


conclusoin
A is not a subset of C -> this means every element in A is not in C
to find a counterexample, we need to show that A is a subset of C

let A = {1}
let B = {2}
let C = {1,3}



4. for all sets A,B, and C, if B U C is a subset of A then
(A - B) A (A - C) = empty set
premise
B U C is a subset of A
this means every element in B or C is in A

conclusion
(A - B) A (A - C) = empty set
to find counterexample we need to find at least one elemnt in (A - B) and (A - C)

let A = {1,2,3}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

since we found a counterexample theefore the statement is false

For each of 5–21 prove each statement that is true and 
find a counterexample for each statement that is false. 
Assume all sets are subsets of a universal set U

5. for all sets A,B, and C
A - (B - C) = (A - B) - C

answer: is the statement true or false?
this seems like a simple commutative law for difference of sets so it must be true but I'm not sure

let A = {1,2,3}
let B = {2}
let C = {}

LHS -> A - (B - C)
an element is in this set if its in A AND if its not in (B - C) -> B^c or C^c
so x is in LHS if x is in A and (x is not in B or x is in C)


RHS -> (A - B) - C
an element is in this set if its in (A - B) and not in C
so x is in  RHS if its (x is in A and x is not in b) AND x is not in C
this means to find the counterexample we need to make LHS does not equal to RHS

let A = {1,2}
let B = {1}
let C = {2}

6. for all sets A and B, A A (A U B) = A

LFS -> A A (A U B)
this means:
x must be in A
x must be in A or B

LHS = A
this means x must be in A

to find a counterexample, we need to make LHS does not equal to RHS

let A = {1}
let B = {2}

LHS -> 1 A {1,2} = 1
RHS -> 1

not valid, need a different example
let A = {}
let B = {1}

seems to be true, but not sure. lets try to prove it
suppost a,b are any sets
we must show A A (A U B) = A, that is
we must show 2 things:
1) A A (A U B) is a subset of A
2) A is a subset of A (A U B)

part 1:
let x be any eleemnt in 
A A (A U B)
this means x is in a and
x is in A or B

since x is in a, therefore A A (A U B) is a subset of A

part 2:
A is a subset of A A (A U B)
A -> x is in A
(A U B) -> by thedefinition of union, x is in A or x is in B
since we know x is in A, therfore this is true
therefore the statment is true


7. for all sets A, B, and C,
(A - B) A (C - B) = A - (B U C)

LHS -> (A - B) A (C - B)
x is in A but not in B
and
x is in C but not in B

RHS -> A - (B U C)
x is in a
but not in (B or C)

to find a coutnerexample, we need to make LHS does not equal RHS

let A = {1,4}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

LHS -> (1,4 - 2) A (3 - 2) = {}

RHS -> 1,4 - 2,3 = 1,4

therfore counterexample found

8. for all sets A and B, if A^c is a subset of B, then A U B = U

9. for all sets A,B, and C, if A is a subset of C and B is a subset oc C then A U B is a subset of C
