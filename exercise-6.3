exercise set 6.3
For each of 1–4 find a counterexample to show that the 
statement is false. Assume all sets are subsets of a univer
sal set U.

1. for all sets a,b, and c,
(A U B) A C = A U (B A C)

(A U B) A C  - an element is here if its in a or b and c
A U (B A C) - an element is here if its in a or if its both in b and c

let A = {1}
let B = {2,3}
let C = {3,4}

A U B = {1,2,3}
A U B A C = {3}

B∩C={2,3}∩{3,4}={3}

A∪(B∩C)={1}∪{3}={1,3}
since counterrexample is found tehrefore false

2. for all sets a and b, (A U B)^c = A^c U B^c
answer:

let the universal set U be {1,2,3}
let A = {1}
let B = {2}

LHS: (A U B)^c
this means an element is here if its not in A and not in B
A U B = 1,2
(A U B)^c = 3

RHS: A^c U B^c
this means an element is here if it's not in A or not in B
A^c = {2,3}
B^c = {1,3}
A^c U B^c = {1,2,3}

since RHS does not equal to RHS, therefore we found a counterexample and the statement is false


3. for all sets a,b,and c, if a is not a subset of b and b is not a subsetof c then
a is not a subset of c

premise
1. A is not a subset of B
2. B is not a subset of C


conclusoin
A is not a subset of C -> this means every element in A is not in C
to find a counterexample, we need to show that A is a subset of C

let A = {1}
let B = {2}
let C = {1,3}



4. for all sets A,B, and C, if B U C is a subset of A then
(A - B) A (A - C) = empty set
premise
B U C is a subset of A
this means every element in B or C is in A

conclusion
(A - B) A (A - C) = empty set
to find counterexample we need to find at least one elemnt in (A - B) and (A - C)

let A = {1,2,3}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

since we found a counterexample theefore the statement is false

For each of 5–21 prove each statement that is true and 
find a counterexample for each statement that is false. 
Assume all sets are subsets of a universal set U

5. for all sets A,B, and C
A - (B - C) = (A - B) - C

answer: is the statement true or false?
this seems like a simple commutative law for difference of sets so it must be true but I'm not sure

let A = {1,2,3}
let B = {2}
let C = {}

LHS -> A - (B - C)
an element is in this set if its in A AND if its not in (B - C) -> B^c or C^c
so x is in LHS if x is in A and (x is not in B or x is in C)


RHS -> (A - B) - C
an element is in this set if its in (A - B) and not in C
so x is in  RHS if its (x is in A and x is not in b) AND x is not in C
this means to find the counterexample we need to make LHS does not equal to RHS

let A = {1,2}
let B = {1}
let C = {2}

6. for all sets A and B, A A (A U B) = A

LFS -> A A (A U B)
this means:
x must be in A
x must be in A or B

LHS = A
this means x must be in A

to find a counterexample, we need to make LHS does not equal to RHS

let A = {1}
let B = {2}

LHS -> 1 A {1,2} = 1
RHS -> 1

not valid, need a different example
let A = {}
let B = {1}

seems to be true, but not sure. lets try to prove it
suppost a,b are any sets
we must show A A (A U B) = A, that is
we must show 2 things:
1) A A (A U B) is a subset of A
2) A is a subset of A (A U B)

part 1:
let x be any eleemnt in 
A A (A U B)
this means x is in a and
x is in A or B

since x is in a, therefore A A (A U B) is a subset of A

part 2:
A is a subset of A A (A U B)
A -> x is in A
(A U B) -> by thedefinition of union, x is in A or x is in B
since we know x is in A, therfore this is true
therefore the statment is true


7. for all sets A, B, and C,
(A - B) A (C - B) = A - (B U C)

LHS -> (A - B) A (C - B)
x is in A but not in B
and
x is in C but not in B

RHS -> A - (B U C)
x is in a
but not in (B or C)

to find a coutnerexample, we need to make LHS does not equal RHS

let A = {1,4}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

LHS -> (1,4 - 2) A (3 - 2) = {}

RHS -> 1,4 - 2,3 = 1,4

therfore counterexample found

8. for all sets A and B,
if A^c is a subset of B, then A U B = U

premise - what we know
A^c is a subset of B
this means every element not in A is in B

conclusion
A U B = U
a or b makes up the universal set

we need to show 2 things:
1 - A U B is a subset of U
2 - U is a subset of A U B

part 1: A U B is a subset of U
let x be an arbitrary element in the universal set U
case 1: x is in A
since x is in A therefore x E A U B by the definition of unio

case 2: x is not in A
since we know from the premise every element not in A is in B, then x is in B, therfore x E A U B

part 2: A U B is a subset of U
by the definition os universal set, this is always true.
therefore both statements are proven.


9. for all sets A,B, and C,
if A is a subset of C and B is a subset of C then A U B is a subset of C

premise - what we know
A is a subset of C and B is a subset of C
this means every element in A is in C
and
every element in B is in C

conclusion:
A U B is a subset of C
this means every eleemnt in A or B is in C

we must show the conclusion holds
A U B is a subset of C
case 1: x is in A
since we know that A is a subset of C from the premise, then x is in C 

A U B
case 2: x is in B
since we know that B is in C by from the premise, then x isi n C

10. for all sets A,B, if A is a subset of B,
then A A B^c = the empty set

premise - what we know
A is a subset of B
this means every element in A is in B

conclusion - what we need to prove
A A B^c = the empty set
this means A and not b contains no element

we must show the conclusion holds
A A B^c = the empty Set
suppose x is in A A B^c
this means x is in A and x is not in B
but we konw from the premise that every element in A is in B
so an element cannot be in B and not in B at the same time
therefore the supposition is false

11. for all sets a,b, and c, if A is a subset of B, then
A A (B A C)^c = the empty set

premise - what we know
 A is a subset of B
 this means eveyr element in A is in B

conclusion - what we need to prove
A A (B A C)^c = the empty set

suppose the opposite: suppose x is in
A A (B A C)^c
this means x is in A
and
x is not in both (B and C)
or by de margans law, this means x is not in B or x is not in C

let A = {1}
let A = {1,2}
let A = {2}


12. for all sets A,B,and C,
A A (B - C) = (A A B) - (A A C)

lets try some arbitrary example
A = {1,2}
B = {2}
C = {1,3}

LHS -> 1,2 A 2 = 2

RHS -> 2 - 1,3 = 2
seems to be true

general proof
we must show 2 things:
1. A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)
2. (A A B) - (A A C) is a subset of A A (B - C)

part 1: show that A A (B - C) is a subset of (A A B) - (A A C)
let x be any elemnt in A A (B - C)
we must show x is in (A A B) - (A A C)

premise:
A A (B - C)
by the definition of difference, x is not in C
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and B but not in C

(A A B) - (A A C)
(A A B)
by the definition of intersect, x is in A and x is in B - satisfied as per premise
(A A C)
by thedefintion of intersect, x is in A and x is in C
since we know x is not in c, x cannot be in this intersect

part 2: (A A B) - (A A C) is a subset of A A (B - C)
premise: 
(A A B) - (A A C)
x E A and x E B
x is not in A A C

we need to show x is in A A (B - C)
A -> since we know x is in A, therfore this part is satisfied
for x to be in B - C, it must be in B and not in C. we know these facts from the premise
threfore satifisd



13. for all sets a,b, and c
A U (B - C) = (A U B) - (A U C)

let A = {1}
let B = {2}
let C = {3}

A U (B - C) = {1,2}
(A U B) - (A U C) = {1-2} - {1,3} = {2}

therefore is false

H 14. For all sets A, B, and C,
if A A C = B A C and A U C = B U C, then A = B

premise - what we know
A A C = B U C
A A C -> x is in A and x is in C
B U C -> x is in B or x is in C
A A C = B U C -> every element in A and C is a subset of B or C, and
every element in B or C is a subset of A and C

conclusion - what we need to prove
A = B

we must prove 2 things:
1. A is a subset of B
2. B is a subset of A

1. show that A is a subset of B, that is we need to show x is in B
case 1: x E C
since we know x E A and x E C therefore x E A A C
therefore x E B U C

case 2: x is not in C
since x E A, we know that A U C because premise 2 (A U C = B U C)
therefore x must be in B U C
x E B UC means x is in B or x is in C
since x is not in C, therefore x isi n B

2. B is a subset of A
show that B is a subset of A, that is we need to show x is in a

case 1: x E C
since x E b and x E C, therefore B A C -> therefore A A C, therefore x E A

case 2: x is not in C
since x E B, x E B U C. threfore x must be in A U C. since x E AU C means x E A or x E C,
we know x is not in x E C, therefore x is in A


H 15. For all sets A, B, and C,
(A − B) ∪ C ⊆ A ∪ (C − B).

let x be any element in (A − B) ∪ C
we must show x is in A ∪ (C − B)

LHS -> (A − B) ∪ C
x is in (A but not in B) or x is in C

RHS -> A ∪ (C − B)
x is in A or (x is in C and not in B)

case 1: x E (A - B)
since we know x E A - B, by the definition of union x is in A
therefore x E A ∪ (C − B).

case 2: x E C
1: x E A
since we know x E C and x E A, therefore by the definition of union x E (A - B) U C

2: x is not in a
since x is not in A, then it's on the other part of union (C - B)
for x to be in (C - B). it must satify 2 conditions:
condition 1: x E C -> we know this from case 2
condition 2: x is not in B

H 16. For all sets A and B, if A ∩ B = ∅ then A × B = ∅.

pick arbitrary set
let A = {1}
let B = {2}

A x B = (1,2)
therefore this statement is false since we found a counterexample

17. For all sets A and B, if A ⊆ B then P(A) ⊆ P(B).

lets try picking arbitrary set
let A = {1}
let B = {1,2}

PA = {empty set, 1}
PB = {empty set, 1, 2, (1,2)}

seems to be true.
try with Proof

premise: A is a subset of B
by the definition of subset, every element in A is in B

conclusion: P(A) is a subset of P(B)
let x be arbitrary element in P(A)
since x is an element of a power set, then by the definition of power set , x is a set (not a regular elemenet)
so x E A , since we know x E A and a E B, therefore x E B
and by the definition of power set, p(A) is a subst of P(B)


18. For all sets A and B, P(A ∪ B) ⊆ P(A) ∪ P(B).

counterexample
A = {1}
B = {2}

P(A U B) = P(1,2) = {{empty set},{1},{2},{1,2}}

P(A) = P(1) = {{empty set},{1}}
P(B) = P(2) = {{empty set},{2}}
P(A) ∪ P(B) = {{empty set},{1},{2}}
therefore the satement is false

H 19. For all sets A and B, P(A) ∪ P(B) ⊆ P(A ∪ B).

counterexample attempt
A = {1}
B = {2}


P(A) = P(1) = {{empty set},{1}}
P(B) = P(2) = {{empty set},{2}}
P(A) ∪ P(B) = {{empty set},{1},{2}}
P(A U B) = P(1,2) = {{empty set},{1},{2},{1,2}}

looks correct, seems like a subset
general proof

let x be arbitratry element in P(A) ∪ P(B)
we mst show x is in P(A ∪ B)

by the definition of union, x E P(A) or x E P(B)

case 1: x E P(A)
since x is an element of P(A), then by the definition of power set x is a subset of A

case 2: x E P(B)
since x is an element of P(B), then by the definition of power set x is a subset of B
since both cases are prove, therefore true

20. For all sets A and B, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) ∩ P(B).

let A = {1}
let B = {2}

P(A) = P(1) = {{empty set},{1}}
P(B) = P(2) = {{empty set},{2}}
P(A A B) = P(empty set) = {{the empty set}}
P(A) ∩ P(B) = {{the empty set}}

seems toe be true. general proof:

part 1: prove P(A ∩ B) is a subset of P(A) ∩ P(B).
let x be any element in P(A ∩ B)
we must show x is in P(A) ∩ P(B).
by the definition of power set, x is a subset of A A B
by the definition of intersection, since A A B is a subset of A and A A B is a subset of B,
then x is a subset of A and x is a subset of B
since x is a subset of a, then x E P(A)
cine x is a subset of b, then x E P(B)
since x is an element of P(A) and x is an element of P(B), then X E P(A) A P(B)

part 2 : prove P(A) ∩ P(B) is a subset of P(A ∩ B)
let x be arbitary element in  P(A) ∩ P(B).
by the definition of intersection, x is in P(A) and x is in P(B)
by the definition of power set, x is a subset of A and x is a subset of B
since x is a subset of A and x is a subset of B,
every element must be in A and B, therefore x is a subset of A A B
by the definition of power set, since X is a subseto f A A B, then X E P(A A B)

21. For all sets A and B, P(A × B) = P(A) × P(B).

let A = {1}
let B = {2}
P(A) = P(1) = {{empty set},{1}}
P(B) = P(2) = {{empty set},{2}}
P(A)×P(B)={(∅,∅),(∅,{2}),({1},∅),({1},{2})}
(A x B) = {(1,2)}
P(A x B) = P(1,2) = {{empty set},{1,2}}
since its diffrent we've found a counterexample
