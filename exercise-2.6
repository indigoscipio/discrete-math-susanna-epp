Exercise set 3.1
1. A menagerie consists of seven brown dogs, two 
black dogs, six gray cats, ten black cats, five blue 
birds, six yellow birds, and one black bird. Deter
mine which of the following statements are true 
and which are false.

M = {7 brown dogs,2 black dogs,6 gray cats,10 black cats,5 blue birds,6 yellow birds,1 black bird}

a. There is an animal in the menagerie that is red.
this statement is false, there is no single red animal {Ex E M, x is red} = false

b. Every animal in the menagerie is a bird or a mammal.
{Ax E M | x is (Bird V Mammal)} = this statement is true

c. every animal in the menagerie is brown or gray or black
{Ax E M | x is (Brown V Gray V Black)} = this statement is false. There is a blue and yellow color in Menagerie

d. There is an animal in the menagerie that is neither a cat nor a dog.
{Ex E M | x is ~(Cat V Dog)} = true there is at least one occurence of bird (which is neither a cat nor a dog)

e. no animal in the menagerie is blue
false because there is a blue bird in Menagerie

f. There are in the menagerie a dog, a cat, and a bird that all have the same color.
this statement is true because there exists a black dog, a black cat, and black bird in which all have the same color

2. Indicate which of the following statements are true 
and which are false. Justify your answers as best 
as you can.
a. every integer is a real number = this is true because integer is a subset of real number (I think?)
example: positive integer is real number and also integer, -integer is also a real number and integer, 0 is also both integer and real number

b. 0 is a positive real number
I think this statment is false because zero is neither negative is positive.

c. for every real number r, -r is a negative real number
This one's true i think, because if we take positive r then the negative is always the same r

d. every real number is an integer
i think this statement is false because no integer can be decimal or fraction

3.  Let R(m, n) be the predicate“If m is a factor of n^2 
then m is a factor of n,” with domain for both m 
and n being Z the set of integers.

R(m,n) = if m is a factor of n^2 -> m is a factor of n
m,n is an element of Z set of integers

a. Explain why R(m, n) is false if m = 25 and n = 10.
R(25,10) = if 25 is a factor of 10^2 -> 25 is a factor of 10
true -> false
this is false because the conclusion of this implication is false, 25 is not a factor of 10

b. Give values different from those in part (a) for 
which R(m, n) is false.
answer: R(25,10), R(50,10), R(100,10)


c. Explain why R(m, n) is true if m = 5 and n = 10.
R(5,10) = if 5 is a factor of 10^2 -> 5 is a factor of 10
true -> true
this is true because the premise and conclusion of this implication is both true, 5 is a factor of 10

d.  Give values different from those in part (c) for 
which R(m, n) is true.
answer: R(2,4), R(2,8), R(2,16)

4. Let Q(x, y) be the predicate “If x < y then x^2 < y^2”  
with domain for both x and y being R the set of real numbers.

Q = { (x,y) E R x R | x < y -> X^2 < y^2}
a. Explain why Q(x, y) is false if x = -2 and y 1.
-2 < 1 -> -2^2 < 1^2 = true -> 4 < 1 (false)
this statement is false because the premise is true but conclusion for this implication is false.

b. Give values different from those in part (a) for which Q(x, y) is false.
answer: Q(-3,2) Q(-4,3)

c. Explain why Q(x, y) is true if x = 3 and y = 8.
3 < 8 -> -3^2 < 8^2 = true -> 9 < 64 (true)
it is true because the premise and conclusion are both true so it satisfied the given implication

d. Give values different from those in part (c) for which Q(x, y) is true
answer: Q(3,8), Q(4,9), Q(5,10)

5. Find the truth set of each predicate.
a. predicate: 6/d is an integer, domain: Z
truth set: {...,6/-3,6/-2,6/-1,6/0, 6/1,6/2,6/3,...}
since this is integer it cant be fractions so
truth set: {... -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}

b. predicate: 6/d is an integer, domain: Z+
truth set: {1, 2, 3, 6, ...}

c. Predicate: 1 <= x^2 <= 4, domain: R
truth set: {all numberse between -2, -1 and 1,2}

d. Predicate: 1 <= x^2 <= 4, domain: Z
truth set: {-1,-2,1,2}

6. Let B(x) be -10 < x < 10 Find the truth set of 
B(x) for each of the following domains.
a. Z
truth set of B(x): {-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}

b. Z+
truth set of B(x): {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}


c. The set of all even integers
truth set of B(x): {-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8}

7. Let S be the set of all strings of length 3 consist
ing of a’s, b’s, and c’s. List all the strings in S that 
satisfy the following conditions:

S = {sss} where s is either a,b, or c
a. every string in S begins with b
{baa, bab, bac, bba, bbb, bbc, bca, bcb, bcc}

b. No string in S has more than one c
{
    aaa, aab, aac,
    aba, abb, abc,
    aca, acb,
    baa, bab, bac
    bba, bbb, bbc,
    bca, bcb,
    caa, cab,
    cba, cbb,
}

8. Let T be the set of all strings of length 3 consisting 
of 0’s and 1’s. List all the strings in T that satisfy 
the following conditions:
T = {sss} where s is either 0 or 1

a. For every string s in T, the second character 
of s is 1 or the first two characters of s are 
the same.
no {s1s} OR {00s, 11s}

all possible combination: {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}
following the first rule so the final answer is
{000, 001, 010, 011, 101, 110, 111}


b. No string in T has all three characters the same.
{001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110}

Find counterexamples to show that the statements in 
9–12 are false. A = All (universal quantifier)
9. Ax E R, x >= 1/x
answer: 0.5
0.5 >= 1/0.5
0.5 >= 2 (this counterexample makes the statement false)


10. Ax E Z, (a-1)/a is not an integer
answer: 0
(0-1)/0 = anything divided with 0 is undefined thus false

11. All positive integers m and n, m x n >= m + n
answer: m=1 and n=1
1 x 1 >= 1 + 1
1 >= 2, which is false

12. All real numbers x and y, sqrt(x+y) = sqrt(x) + sqrt(y)
answer: x= 4, y=-4
sqrt(4-4) = sqrt(4) + sqrt(-4)
0 = 2 + i which is not equal

13. Consider the following statement:
For All basketball player x, x is tall

 Which of the following are equivalent ways of 
expressing this statement?
a.Every basketball player is tall
answer: yes, since every is equivalent with for all
b. Among all the basketball players, some   are tall.
answer: this is not equivalent because some implies existensial quantifier
c. Some of all the tall people are basketball  players.
answer: again not equivalent because some is not all
d. All people who are basketball players are tall
answer: yes this is equivalent since all of the people who are basketbal players are all tall
e. Anyone who is a basketball player is a tall person
answer: i'm not sure about this one but let's just go with yes this is equivalent becuase any people who's a basketball player is tall

14. Consider the following statement:
 Ex E R such that x^2 = 2.

Which of the following are equivalent ways of 
expressing this statement?

a.The square of each real number is 2.
this is an incorrect equivalent since each implies every/all.

b.  Some real numbers have square 2.
answer: incorrect because has square 2 is ambiguous sentence it should be a number whose square equal to 2

c.  The number x has square 2, for some real number x
answer: correct

d. Some real number has square 2.
answer: incorrect because has square 2 is ambiguous sentence it should be a number whose square equal to 2
