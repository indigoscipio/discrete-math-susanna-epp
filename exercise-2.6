Exercise set 3.1
1. A menagerie consists of seven brown dogs, two 
black dogs, six gray cats, ten black cats, five blue 
birds, six yellow birds, and one black bird. Deter
mine which of the following statements are true 
and which are false.

M = {7 brown dogs,2 black dogs,6 gray cats,10 black cats,5 blue birds,6 yellow birds,1 black bird}

a. There is an animal in the menagerie that is red.
this statement is false, there is no single red animal {Ex E M, x is red} = false

b. Every animal in the menagerie is a bird or a mammal.
{Ax E M | x is (Bird V Mammal)} = this statement is true

c. every animal in the menagerie is brown or gray or black
{Ax E M | x is (Brown V Gray V Black)} = this statement is false. There is a blue and yellow color in Menagerie

d. There is an animal in the menagerie that is neither a cat nor a dog.
{Ex E M | x is ~(Cat V Dog)} = true there is at least one occurence of bird (which is neither a cat nor a dog)

e. no animal in the menagerie is blue
false because there is a blue bird in Menagerie

f. There are in the menagerie a dog, a cat, and a bird that all have the same color.
this statement is true because there exists a black dog, a black cat, and black bird in which all have the same color

2. Indicate which of the following statements are true 
and which are false. Justify your answers as best 
as you can.
a. every integer is a real number = this is true because integer is a subset of real number (I think?)
example: positive integer is real number and also integer, -integer is also a real number and integer, 0 is also both integer and real number

b. 0 is a positive real number
I think this statment is false because zero is neither negative is positive.

c. for every real number r, -r is a negative real number
This one's true i think, because if we take positive r then the negative is always the same r

d. every real number is an integer
i think this statement is false because no integer can be decimal or fraction

3.  Let R(m, n) be the predicate“If m is a factor of n^2 
then m is a factor of n,” with domain for both m 
and n being Z the set of integers.

R(m,n) = if m is a factor of n^2 -> m is a factor of n
m,n is an element of Z set of integers

a. Explain why R(m, n) is false if m = 25 and n = 10.
R(25,10) = if 25 is a factor of 10^2 -> 25 is a factor of 10
true -> false
this is false because the conclusion of this implication is false, 25 is not a factor of 10

b. Give values different from those in part (a) for 
which R(m, n) is false.
answer: R(25,10), R(50,10), R(100,10)


c. Explain why R(m, n) is true if m = 5 and n = 10.
R(5,10) = if 5 is a factor of 10^2 -> 5 is a factor of 10
true -> true
this is true because the premise and conclusion of this implication is both true, 5 is a factor of 10

d.  Give values different from those in part (c) for 
which R(m, n) is true.
answer: R(2,4), R(2,8), R(2,16)

4. Let Q(x, y) be the predicate “If x < y then x^2 < y^2”  
with domain for both x and y being R the set of real numbers.

Q = { (x,y) E R x R | x < y -> X^2 < y^2}
a. Explain why Q(x, y) is false if x = -2 and y 1.
-2 < 1 -> -2^2 < 1^2 = true -> 4 < 1 (false)
this statement is false because the premise is true but conclusion for this implication is false.

b. Give values different from those in part (a) for which Q(x, y) is false.
answer: Q(-3,2) Q(-4,3)

c. Explain why Q(x, y) is true if x = 3 and y = 8.
