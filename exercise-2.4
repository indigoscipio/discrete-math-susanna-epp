1. the input/output table for a digital logic circuit is a table that shows (0 or 1/its truth value )
2. the boolean expession that corresponds to a digital logic circuit is logic gate
3. a recognizier is a digital logic circuit that outputs 1 for a certain combination of input signals and outputs 0 for remaining combinations
4. two digital logic circuits are equivalent if and only if they have the same input/output table truth values
5. a NAND-gate is constructed by placing a NOT gate immediately following an AND gate
6. a NOR gate is ocnstucted by placing a NOT gate immediately following an OR gate



exercise set 2.4
Give the output signals for the circuits in 1–4 if the input 
signals are as indicated.

1. input signals
