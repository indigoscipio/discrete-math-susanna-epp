6. The triangle inqueality says that for all real numbers x and y, ____

Exercise set 4.5
For each of the values of n and d given in 1â€“6,
find integers q and r such that n = dq + r and 0 <= r < d.

1. n = 70, d = 9
n = dq + r
70 = 9 . 7 + 7
q = 7
r = 7

2. n = 62, d = 7
62 = 7 . 8 + 6
q = 8, r = 6

3. n = 36, d = 40
36 = 40 . q + r
36 = 40 . 0 + 36
q = 0, r = 36

4. n = 3, d = 11
3 = 11 . q + r
q = 0
r = 3

5. n = -45, d = 11
-45 = 11 . q + r
q = -5
r = 10

6. n = -27, d = 8
-27 = 8 . q + r
q = -4
r = 5


evaluate the expressions in 7 - 10
div = quotient, mod = reminder
7. a. 43 div 9 = 4
b. 43 mod 9 = 7

8. a. 50 div 7 = 7
b. 50 mod 7 = 1

9.a. 28 div 5 = 5
b. 28 mod 5 = 3

10.a. 30 div 2 = 15
b. 30 mod 2 = 0

11. check the correctness of formula 4.5.1 given in example 4.5.3
for the following values of DayT and N

365 div 7 = 52
365 mod 7 = 1
dayN = (DayT + N) mod7

a. DayT = 6 (saturday) and N = 15
= 6 + 15 mod 7
= 21 mod 7 = 0

b. DayT = 0 (sunday) and N = 7
= 7 + 0 mod 7
= 7 mod 7 = 0

a. DayT = 4 (thursday) and N = 12
= 12 + 4 mod 7
= 16 mod 7 = 2

12. Justify formula (4.5.1) for general values of DayT and N.
The formulate wokrs because day of the week repeats from Mon - Sunday 
We can map the day of the week in numbers from 0 - 6
The starting point is day T, plus how many N days after that
Module 7 ensures we stay within the 7 day cycle and correctly pick any day after n days


13. on a monday a friend says he will meet you again in 30 days.
What day of the week will that be?
Monday (DayT) = 0
DayN = 30
30 + 0 mod 7 = 2
Therefore the day of the week is Wednesday

14. If today is tuesday, how what day of the week will it be 1000 days from today?
DayT = 1 (Tuesday)
DayN = 1000
1000 + 1 mod 7
= 1001 mod7 = 0 (Monday)

15. January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, and 2000 was a leap year.
What day of the week will January 1, 2050, be?

leap years = 13 x 2 = +26
Regular year = 50 - 13 = +37 
total shift = 63
63 mod 7 = 0 = saturday

16. Suppose d is a positive and n is any integer.
if d | n, what is the reminder obtained when the quotient-reminder theorem is applied to n with divisor d?

n = d q + r and  0 <= r < d
since d | n this means that n = d . a for some integer a, and since d divides n perfectly the reminder is always 0

17. Prove directly from the definitions that for every integer n, n^2 -n + 3 is odd
Use division into 2 cases: n is even and n is odd
case 1: n is even
by the definition of even, an umber is even if it can be written as 2k for some integer k

n^2 - n + 3
= (2k)^2 - 2k + 3
= 4k^2 - 2k + 3
= 2(k^2 - k + 1) + 1

let t = (k^2 - k + 1). since integer squared minus integer plus one is an integer, t is an integer
therefore by the definition of odd, n^2 - n + 3 is odd

case 2: n is odd
By the definition of odd, a number is odd if it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k
n^2 - n + 3
= (2k+1)^2 - 2k + 1 + 3
= ( 4k^2 + 2k + 1) - (2k + 1) + 3
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 2k -1 +3
= 4k^2 + 2k + 3
= 2 (2k^2 + k + 1) + 1

let r = (2k^2 + k + 1). Since integer squard plus product of integer plus integer is an integer, r is an intger
therefore by the definition of odd, n^2 - n + 3 is odd

18. a. prove that the product of any two consecutive integers is even
By the definition of consecutive number, a number is consecutive to another if it can be written as n + 1
Product of two consecutive number can be written as n * (n +1)

By the definition of even, a number is even if it can be written as n = 2k for some integer k
then we can substitute

2k * (2k + 1)
= 4k^2 + 2k
= 2(k^2 + k)
let t = k^2+k, since integer squard plus some integer is integer, t is an intger
therfore following definition of even, 2k * (2k + 1) is even


b. the result of part (a) suggests that the second approach is in the discussion of example 4.5.7 might be possible after al.
write a new prooof of theorem 4.5.3 based on this observation.
let n = 2k + 1
n = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4k (k + 1) + 1
since k(k+1) is a product of two consecutive integer this proves that this is always even

19.  Prove directly from the definitions that for all integers m and n, if m and n have the same  parity,
then 5m + 7n is even. Divide into two cases: m and n are both even and m and n are both odd

case 1 -> m and n are both even
let m = 2r, n = 2s (by the definition of even)
5 (2r) + 7 (2s)
= 10r + 14s
= 2 (5r + 7s)
let t = (5r + 7s) which is an integer -> therefore 5m + 7n is even by the definition of even

case 2 -> m and n are both odd
let m = 2r + 1 and n = 2s + 1 by the definitino of odd
5 (2r+1) + 7 (2s+1)
10r + 14s + 12
= 2 (5r + 7s + 6)
let t = (5r + 7s + 6) which is an integer -> therefore 5m + 7n is even by the definition of even

20. Suppose a is any integer. If a mod 7 = 4, what is 5a mod 7?
In other words, if division of a by 7 gives a remainder of 4, what is the remainder when 5a is divided by 7?
Your solution should show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with.

By the definition of quotient remainder, a = d q + r where 0 <= r < day

a mod 7 = 4
5a mod = ??
By the definition of quotient remainder, a = d q + r where 0 <= r < d,
this means there is some integer q so that

a = 7q + 4
5a = 5 (7q + 4)
= 35q + 20
= 7(5q + 2) + 6

Since (5q + 2) is an integer (because the products of sums of integersa re integers)
and since 0 <= 6 < 7, the reminder obtained when 5a divided by 7 is 6, therefore
5a mod 7 = 6


21. Suppose b is any integer. If b mod 12 = 5, what is 8b mod 12?
In other words, if division of b by 12 gives a remainder of 5, what is the remainder when 8b is divided by 12?
Your solution should show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with.

b mod 12 = 5
8b mod 12 = ??

By the definition of quotient remainder, a = d q + r where 0 <= r < d,
this means there is some integer q so that
b = 12q + 5, then we can substitute

8b = 8(12q + 5)
= 96q + 40
= 12 (8q + 3) + 4

Since (8q + 3) is an integer (because the products of sums of integersa re integers)
and since 0 <= 4 < 12, the reminder obtained when 8b divided by 12 is 4, therefore
8b mod 12 = 4

22. Suppose c is any integer. If c mod 15 = 3, what is 10c mod 15? In other words, if division of c by 
15 gives a remainder of 3, what is the remainder when 10c is divided by 15? Your solution should
show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with

c mod 15 = 3
10c mod 15 = ???

c = 15q + 3
10c = 10 (15q + 3)
= 150q + 30
= 15 (10q + 2) + 0

since (10q + 2) is an integer (because the product of sums of integers is integer)
and since 0 <= 0 < 15, the reminder obtained when 10c is divided by 15 is 0,
therefore 10c mod 15 = 0

23. prove that for every integer n, if n mod 5 = 3, then n^2 mod 5 = 4

24. prove that for all integers m and n, if m mod 5 = 2
and n mod 5 = 1, then mn mod 5 = 2

25. prove that for all integers a and b, if a mod 7 = 5,
and b mod 7 = 6, then ab mod 7 = 2
