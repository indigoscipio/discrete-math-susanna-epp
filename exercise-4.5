Exercise set 4.5
For each of the values of n and d given in 1–6,
find integers q and r such that n = dq + r and 0 <= r < d.

1. n = 70, d = 9
n = dq + r
70 = 9 . 7 + 7
q = 7
r = 7

2. n = 62, d = 7
62 = 7 . 8 + 6
q = 8, r = 6

3. n = 36, d = 40
36 = 40 . q + r
36 = 40 . 0 + 36
q = 0, r = 36

4. n = 3, d = 11
3 = 11 . q + r
q = 0
r = 3

5. n = -45, d = 11

evaluate the expressions in 7 - 10
div = quotient, mod = reminder
7. a. 43 div 9 = 4
b. 43 mod 9 = 7

8. a. 50 div 7 = 7
b. 50 mod 7 = 1

9.a. 28 div 5 = 5
b. 28 mod 5 = 3

10.a. 30 div 2 = 15

11. check the correctness of formula 4.5.1 given in example 4.5.3
for the following values of DayT and N

365 div 7 = 52
365 mod 7 = 1
dayN = (DayT + N) mod7

a. DayT = 6 (saturday) and N = 15
= 6 + 15 mod 7
= 21 mod 7 = 0

b. DayT = 0 (sunday) and N = 7
= 7 + 0 mod 7
= 7 mod 7 = 0

a. DayT = 4 (thursday) and N = 12
= 12 + 4 mod 7
= 16 mod 7 = 2

12. Justify formula (4.5.1) for general values of DayT and N.
The formulate wokrs because day of the week repeats from Mon - Sunday 
We can map the day of the week in numbers from 0 - 6
The starting point is day T, plus how many N days after that
Module 7 ensures we stay within the 7 day cycle and correctly pick any day after n days


13. on a monday a friend says he will meet you again in 30 days.
What day of the week will that be?
Monday (DayT) = 0
DayN = 30
30 + 0 mod 7 = 2
Therefore the day of the week is Wednesday

14. If today is tuesday, how what day of the week will it be 1000 days from today?
DayT = 1 (Tuesday)
DayN = 1000
1000 + 1 mod 7
= 1001 mod7 = 0 (Monday)

15. January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, and 2000 was a leap year.
What day of the week will January 1, 2050, be?

leap years = 13 x 2 = +26
Regular year = 50 - 13 = +37 
total shift = 63
63 mod 7 = 0 = saturday

16. Suppose d is a positive and n is any integer.
if d | n, what is the reminder obtained when the quotient-reminder theorem is applied to n with divisor d?

n = d q + r and  0 <= r < d
since d | n this means that n = d . a for some integer a, and since d divides n perfectly the reminder is always 0

17. Prove directly from the definitions that for every integer n, n^2 -n + 3 is odd
Use division into 2 cases: n is even and n is odd
case 1: n is even
by the definition of even, an umber is even if it can be written as 2k for some integer k

n^2 - n + 3
= (2k)^2 - 2k + 3
= 4k^2 - 2k + 3
= 2(k^2 - k + 1) + 1

let t = (k^2 - k + 1). since integer squared minus integer plus one is an integer, t is an integer
therefore by the definition of odd, n^2 - n + 3 is odd

case 2: n is odd
By the definition of odd, a number is odd if it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k
n^2 - n + 3
= (2k+1)^2 - 2k + 1 + 3
= ( 4k^2 + 2k + 1) - (2k + 1) + 3
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 - 2k -1 +3
= 4k^2 + 2k + 3
= 2 (2k^2 + k + 1) + 1

let r = (2k^2 + k + 1). Since integer squard plus product of integer plus integer is an integer, r is an intger
therefore by the definition of odd, n^2 - n + 3 is odd

18. a. prove that the product of any two consecutive integers is even
By the definition of consecutive number, a number is consecutive to another if it can be written as n + 1
Product of two consecutive number can be written as n * (n +1)

By the definition of even, a number is even if it can be written as n = 2k for some integer k
then we can substitute

2k * (2k + 1)
= 4k^2 + 2k
= 2(k^2 + k)
let t = k^2+k, since integer squard plus some integer is integer, t is an intger
therfore following definition of even, 2k * (2k + 1) is even


b. the result of part (a) suggests that the second approach is in the discussion of example 4.5.7 might be possible after al.
write a new prooof of theorem 4.5.3 based on this observation.
let n = 2k + 1
n = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4k (k + 1) + 1
since k(k+1) is a product of two consecutive integer this proves that this is always even

19.  Prove directly from the definitions that for all integers m and n, if m and n have the same  parity,
then 5m + 7n is even. Divide into two cases: m and n are both even and m and n are both odd

case 1 -> m and n are both even
let m = 2r, n = 2s (by the definition of even)
5 (2r) + 7 (2s)
= 10r + 14s
= 2 (5r + 7s)
let t = (5r + 7s) which is an integer -> therefore 5m + 7n is even by the definition of even

case 2 -> m and n are both odd
let m = 2r + 1 and n = 2s + 1 by the definitino of odd
5 (2r+1) + 7 (2s+1)
10r + 14s + 12
= 2 (5r + 7s + 6)
let t = (5r + 7s + 6) which is an integer -> therefore 5m + 7n is even by the definition of even

20. Suppose a is any integer. If a mod 7 = 4, what is 5a mod 7?
In other words, if division of a by 7 gives a remainder of 4, what is the remainder when 5a is divided by 7?
Your solution should show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with.

By the definition of quotient remainder, a = d q + r where 0 <= r < day

a mod 7 = 4
5a mod = ??
By the definition of quotient remainder, a = d q + r where 0 <= r < d,
this means there is some integer q so that

a = 7q + 4
5a = 5 (7q + 4)
= 35q + 20
= 7(5q + 2) + 6

Since (5q + 2) is an integer (because the products of sums of integersa re integers)
and since 0 <= 6 < 7, the reminder obtained when 5a divided by 7 is 6, therefore
5a mod 7 = 6


21. Suppose b is any integer. If b mod 12 = 5, what is 8b mod 12?
In other words, if division of b by 12 gives a remainder of 5, what is the remainder when 8b is divided by 12?
Your solution should show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with.

b mod 12 = 5
8b mod 12 = ??

By the definition of quotient remainder, a = d q + r where 0 <= r < d,
this means there is some integer q so that
b = 12q + 5, then we can substitute

8b = 8(12q + 5)
= 96q + 40
= 12 (8q + 3) + 4

Since (8q + 3) is an integer (because the products of sums of integersa re integers)
and since 0 <= 4 < 12, the reminder obtained when 8b divided by 12 is 4, therefore
8b mod 12 = 4

22. Suppose c is any integer. If c mod 15 = 3, what is 10c mod 15? In other words, if division of c by 
15 gives a remainder of 3, what is the remainder when 10c is divided by 15? Your solution should
show that you obtain the same answer no matter what integer you start with

c mod 15 = 3
10c mod 15 = ???

c = 15q + 3
10c = 10 (15q + 3)
= 150q + 30
= 15 (10q + 2) + 0

since (10q + 2) is an integer (because the product of sums of integers is integer)
and since 0 <= 0 < 15, the reminder obtained when 10c is divided by 15 is 0,
therefore 10c mod 15 = 0

23. prove that for every integer n, if n mod 5 = 3, then n^2 mod 5 = 4
suppose n is any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer [we must shhow that if n mod 5 = 3, then n^2 mod 5 = 4]
by the definition of quotient-remainder, n = dq + r where 0 <= r < d

n mod 5 = 3
n = 5q + 3
n^2 = (5q + 3)^2
n^2 = (5q + 3) (5q + 3)
n^2 = (25q^2 + 15q + 15q + 9)
n^2 = 25q^2 + 30q + 9
n^2 = 5(5q^2 + 6q + 1) + 4

let q = (5q^2 + 6q + 1). Since this is an integer therefore the reminder is +4
therefore we can show that n^2 mod 5 = 4 is true

24. prove that for all integers m and n, if m mod 5 = 2
and n mod 5 = 1, then mn mod 5 = 2

by the definition of quotient-remainder, n = dq + r where 0 <= r < d
m mod 5 = 2
m = 5q + 2

n mod 5 = 1
n = 5r + 1

mn mod 5 = 2
(5q + 2) (5r + 1)
(25qr + 5q + 10r + 2)
= 5 (5qr + q + 2r) + 2
let q = (5qr + q + 2r). Since product of integers plus other integers is an integer q is an integer
then by the definition of quiotient reminder 5q + 2 we get the reminder which is 2 [as was to be hshow]

25. prove that for all integers a and b, if a mod 7 = 5, and b mod 7 = 6, then ab mod 7 = 2

a mod 7 = 5
a = 7q + 5

b mod 7 = 6
b = 7r + 6

ab mod 7 = 2
first we must evaluate ab and divide by 7 to get the reminder
= (7q + 5) (7r + 6)
= 49qr + 42q + 35r + 30
= 7 (7qr + 6q + 5r + 4) + 2

let q = (7qr + 6q + 5r + 4). Since the sum of product of integer is integer, q is an integer
therefore following the quotient rmeinder form, ab = 7q + 2 , we get 2 as the reminder [as to be shown]


26. Prove that a necessary and sufficient condition
for an integer to be divisible by a positive integer d is that n mod d = 0

if d divides n, then n mod d = 0
does d | n?
There exists some integer q such that n = d . q
And d is not 0

Now apply quotient reminder theorem
n mod d = 0
n = dq + 0 where 0 <= r < d
since the rminder is 0, the number n is perfectly divisble by d, therefore d | n


27. Use the quotient-remainder theorem with divisor 
equal to 2 to prove that the square of any integer 
can be written in one of the two forms 4k or 4k+1 
for some integer k.

by the definition of quotient-remainder, n = dq + r where 0 <= r < d
let d = 2
let n be any integer, then n is either of these forms
n = 2k (even)
n = 2k + 1 (odd)

first case: 2k
= 2k^2
= 4.k^2

n^2 mod 4 = 0
Since the reminder is 0 2k is even

second case: 2k + 1
= (2k+1)^2
= (2k + 1)(2k + 1)
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1
= 4 (k^2 + k) + 1

n^2 mod 4 = 1
since the reminder is 1 2k+1 is odd

28.a. prove: given any set of three consecutive integers, one of the integers is a multiple of 3

Three consecutive integer can be written as n (n + 1) (n + 2)
One of the integers is a multiple of 3

n mod 3 -> disivible by 3 (e.g reminder is 0)

n + 1 mod 3 -> 1 more than a multiple of 3 (reminder is 1)
n = 3k + 1 for some integer k
n + 2 = 3k+ 1 + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1), therefore divisible by 3

n + 2 mod 3 -> 2 more than multiple of 3 (reminder is 2)
n + 1 = 3k + 2 + 1 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1) which is divisible by 3

b. use the result of part (a) to prove that any product of three consecutive integers is a multiple of 3

n (n + 1) (n + 2)
Since one of these must include a factor that is divisible by 3, therefore the whole expression is also divisible by 3

29. a. use the quotient reminder theorem with divisor equal to 3 to prove that the square of any integer
has the form 3k or 3k + 1 for some integer k

by the definition of quotient-remainder, n = dq + r where 0 <= r < d


3k -> remainder 0
3k + 1 -> remainder 1

3k^2 = (3k) (3k) = 9k^2 = 3 . 3k^2
3k+1^2 = (3k + 1)(3k + 1) = 9k^2 + 3k + 3k + 1 = 9k^2 + 6k + 1 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) +1

therefore we show that the square of any integer has the form 3k or 3k + 1 for some integer k


b. use the mod notation to rewrite the result of part a
for all integers n, n^2 = 0 mod 3 or n^2 = 1 mod 3

30. a. Use the quotient-remainder theorem with divisor equal to 3 to prove that the product of any 
two consecutive integers has the form 3k or 3k+2 for some integer k

3k -> reminder 0
3k + 2 -> reminder 2

we can write the product of two consecutive integer as x (x + 1)

x = 0, mod 3
0(0 + 1) = 0 mod 3
which means its perfectly divisble by 3, and 3k fits here

x = 1, mod 3
1 (1 + 1) mod 3 = 2 mod 3
which means it leaves a reminder of 2, which is congruent to 3k + 2

x = 2, mod 3
2 (2 + 1) mod 3 = 6 mod 3 = 0
which means its perfectly divisble, and 3k fits here.

Since this follows a pattern, the product of consecutive integer is never congruent to 1 mod 3,
it's always either 0 or 2 mod 3

b. Use the mod notation to rewrite the result of part (a)
Since we know that the product of two consecutive integer is never 1 mod 3, we can show
it as 2 mod 3 or 0 mod 3

 In 31–33, you may use the properties listed in  example 4.3.3.
 
========
Example 4.3.3 Deriving Additional Results about Even and Odd Integers
 Suppose that you have already proved the following properties of even and odd integers:
 1. The sum, product, and difference of any two even integers are even.
 2. The sum and difference of any two odd integers are even.
 3. The product of any two odd integers is odd.

 4. The product of any even integer and any odd integer is even.

 5. The sum of any odd integer and any even integer is odd.

 6. The difference of any odd integer minus any even integer is odd.
 7. The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd.
 ========

31. a.  Prove that for all integers m and n, m+n and m-n are either both odd or both even.
First we must solve for m + n

Suppose m is even and n is odd (or one of m or n is odd)
By property 5, we know that m (even) + n (odd) = odd
By property 7, we know that m (even) - n (odd) = odd

suppose both is even
By property 1 we know that m + n is even
By property 1 we know that m - n is even

suppose both is odd
by property 2 we know that m + n is odd
By property 2 we know that m - n is even

Therefore we have shown that m + n and m - n are either both odd or een


b. find all solutions to the equation m^2 - n^2 = 56 for which both m and n are positive integers

Suppose m and n is both even
m^2 - n^2 = 56
(m + n) (m - n)
m = 9, n = 13
m = 15, n = 13

c. find all solutions to the equations m^2 - n^2 = 88 for which both m and n are positive integers.
m^2 - n^2 = 88
m = 23, n = 21,
n = 13, 9

32. given any integers a,b,and c, if a - b is even and b-c is even,
what can you say about the parity of 2a - (b+c)? prove your answer

a - b = even
 1. The sum, product, and difference of any two even integers are even.
 2. The sum and difference of any two odd integers are even.
 a and b as the same parity (either both odd or evven)

b - c = even
b - c has the same parity as a - b

therefore a - c has the same parity

2a - (b + c)
= all a b c has the same parity
case 1: all are even -> even - (even + even) = even

case 2: all are odd -> odd - (odd + odd) = even - even = even

therefore 2a - (b + c) is always even



33. given any integers a,b,and c if a-b is odd and b-c is even what can you say about the parity of a-c?
prove your answer

a - b = odd
by the propery of

 6. The difference of any odd integer minus any even integer is odd.
 7. The difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd.

a and b has opposite parity
either one a is odd or b is even
or a is even or b is odd

b - c = even
b and c has the same parity


by the property of 
 1. The sum, product, and difference of any two even integers are even.
 2. The sum and difference of any two odd integers are even.
b and c has the same parity
therefore a and c are opposite parity

a - c is odd


34. given any integer n if n > 3 could n, n+2 and n+4 all be prime? prove or give counterexample

n
n + 2
n + 4
one of them must be divisble by 3, because n > 3, and since n > 3 it's impossible.

since primes cant be divisbile by 3 unless they are three, the only the only triple that works is when n = 3


prove each statements in 35 - 43
35. the fourth power of any intger has the form 8m or 8m + 1 for some itneger m
fourth power of any integer

n = 0
0^4 mod 8 = 1
0 mod 8 = 0

n = 1 -> 1 mod 8 = 1

n = 2 -> 16 mod 8 = 0

n = 3 -> 81 mod 8 = 1

n = 4 -> same pattern continued

following the pattern, if n is even, then remainder is 0 (perfectly divisible)
if n is odd, then n^4 mod 8 has a reminder of 1 

36. the product of any four consecutive integers is divisible by 8
We can express the product of four consecutive integer as

n . (n + 1) . (n + 2) . (n + 3)

divisible by 8 means some integer n mod 8 that leaves some reminder r
then we can try

let n = 0 -> 0 . 1 . 2 . 3 = 0 mod 8 = 0
n = 1 -> 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 = 24 mod 8 = 0
n = 2 -> 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 = 120 mod 8 = 0
n = 3 -> 3 . 4 . 5 . 6 = 360 mod 8 = 0

among those 4 consecutive numbers, two of those will eventually be even
at least one of them will be divisbile by 4
then 4 x 2 = 8, so the toal must be divisble b t 8


37. for any integer n, n^2 + 5 is not divisible by 4

a | b can be written as b = a k for some integer k
or n mod 4 = some reminder r

since 4 does not divide n^2 + 5 
4 |\ n^2 + 5

n = 0 -> 5 mod 4 = 1
n = 1 -> 6 mod 4 = 2
n = 2 -> 9 mod 4 = 1
n = 3 -> 14 mod 4 = 2
...

Following the pattern, we see that n^2 + 5 mod 4 never has a reminder of 0 which means its not perfectly divisble by 4


38. for every integer m, m^2 = 5k or m^2 = 5k + 1 or m^2=5k + 4 for some integer k

m^2 = 5k
m^2 = 5k + 1
m^2 = 5k + 4

since m^2 has 5 as a factor, we can write it as m^2 mod 5 = r for some integer r and 0 <= r < d (0 through 4)
let n = 0 -> 0^2 mod 5 = 0 mod 5 = 0
let n = 1 -> 1^2 mod 5 = 1 mod 5 = 1
let n = 2 -> 2^2 mod 5 = 4 mod 5 = 4
let n = 3 -> 3^2 mod 5 = 9 mod 5 = 4
let n = 4 -> 4^2 mod 5 = 16 mod 5 = 1

Following the pattern we see that it leaves the following reminder: 0, 1, and 4
Therefore for every integer m, m^2 = 5k or m^2 = 5k + 1 or m^2 = 5k + 4


39. every prime number except 2 and 3 has the form 6q + 1 or 6q + 5 for some integer q


6q + 1
6q + 5

since both 6q + 1 and 6q + 1 has a factor of 6 it can be written as
p mod 6 = r for some integer r and 0 <= r < d (0 through 5)

6q + 1 or 6q + 5
p = r mod 6 p = 6k + r
let p = 0 -> 0 mod 6 = 6 (not prime)
let p = 1 -> 1 mod 6 = 1 (leaves a reminder of 1) - might be prime
let p = 2 -> 2 mod 6 = 2 (leaves a reminder of 2) - divisble by 2
let p = 3 -> 3 mod 6 = 3 (leaves a reminder of 3) - divisibel by 3
let p = 4 -> 4 mod 6 = 4 (leves a reminder of 4) - divisibel by 2
let p = 5 -> 5 mod 6 = 5 (reminder of 5) - might be prime

therefore  any number p > 3 must have the form 6q + 1 or 6q + 5

40. if n is any odd integer, then n^4 mod 16 = 1

n^4 mod 16 = 1
n mod 16 = some reminder r where 0 <= r < d (0 through 15)

Since n is odd, we can try out the value
let n = 1 -> 1^4 mod 16 = 1
let n = 3 -> 81 mod 16 = 1
let n = 5 -> 625 mod 16 = 1
let n = 7 -> 2401 mod 16 = 1
let n = 9 -> 6561 mod 16 = 1
let n = 11 -> 14641  mod 16 = 1
let n = 13 -> 28561 mod 16 = 1
let n = 15 -> 50625 mod 16 = 1

since all of these has 1 as reminder, therefore n^4 mod 16  =1 


41. for all real numbers x and y, |x| . |y| = |xy|
By the definition of absolute value, an absolute value of x is defined as

| x | = x if x >= 0 and -x if x < 0

case 1: x >= 0, y>=0
let x = 1 and y = 1
|1| . |1| = |1.1|
1 = 1

case 2: x >= 0, y <0
let x = 1 and y = -1
|1| . |-1| = |1 . -1|
1 = 1

case 3: x < 0, y >= 0
let x = -1 and y = 1
|-1| . |1| = |-1 . 1|
1 = 1

case 4: x < 0, y < 0
then |x| = -x, |y| = -y = xy

case 5: either x = 0 or y = 0
then both are euqla
therfore in every case, |x| . |y| = |xy|



42. for all real numbers r anc c with c >= 0, -c <= r <= c if and only if 
|r| <=c (hint, proving a if and only if b requires proving both if a then b and if b then a)

c >= 0
-c <= r <= c if and only if |r| <= c

r > 0
if -c <= r <= c then |r| <= c
By the definition of absolute value,
if r >= 0, then |r| = r
if r < 0, then |r| = -r
since r <= c, r <=c holds true
since r >= c, -r <= c holds true

r < 0
if |r| <= c then -c <= r <= c
|r| = -r
so -r <= c
r >= -c


43. for all real numbers a and b, | |a| - |b| | <= |a - b|
suppose x and y are any real number

let x = a - b
let y = b
