1. The quotient-remainder theorem says that for all 
integers n and d with d >= 0, there exist ___  q 
and r such that ____  and ____.
answer:an integer q and r such that n = d . q + r  and 0 <= r < d


2. if n and d are integers with d > 0, n div d is ___ and n mod d is ____
answer: the quotient, the nonnegative reminder

3. the parity of an integer wheter the integer is ____ 
answer: even or odd

4. according to the quotient-reminder theorem, if an integer n is 
divided by a positive integer d, the possible reminders are ____.
this implies that n can be written in one of the forms ____ for some integer q
answer: 0, 1, 2, ... d-1, dq, dq + 1, dq + 2, dq + ..., dq + d-1

5. to prove a statement of the form "if A1 or A2 or A3, then c", prove ___ and ___ and ___
answer: A1 then C, A2 then C, A3 then C

6. The triangle inqueality says that for all real numbers x and y, ____
|x + y| <= |x| + |y|


Exercise set 4.5
For each of the values of n and d given in 1â€“6,
find integers q and r such that n = dq + r and 0 <= r < d.

1. n = 70, d = 9
n = dq + r
70 = 9 . 7 + 7
q = 7
r = 7

2. n = 62, d = 7
62 = 7 . 8 + 6
q = 8, r = 6

3. n = 36, d = 40
36 = 40 . q + r
36 = 40 . 0 + 36
q = 0, r = 36

4. n = 3, d = 11
3 = 11 . q + r
q = 0
r = 3

5. n = -45, d = 11
-45 = 11 . q + r
q = -5
r = 10

6. n = -27, d = 8
-27 = 8 . q + r
q = -4
r = 5


evaluate the expressions in 7 - 10
div = quotient, mod = reminder
7. a. 43 div 9 = 4
b. 43 mod 9 = 7

8. a. 50 div 7 = 7
b. 50 mod 7 = 1

9.a. 28 div 5 = 5
b. 28 mod 5 = 3

10.a. 30 div 2 = 15
b. 30 mod 2 = 0

11. check the correctness of formula 4.5.1 given in example 4.5.3
for the following values of DayT and N

365 div 7 = 52
365 mod 7 = 1
dayN = (DayT + N) mod7

a. DayT = 6 (saturday) and N = 15
= 6 + 15 mod 7
= 21 mod 7 = 0

b. DayT = 0 (sunday) and N = 7
= 7 + 0 mod 7
= 7 mod 7 = 0

a. DayT = 4 (thursday) and N = 12
= 12 + 4 mod 7
= 16 mod 7 = 2

12. Justify formula (4.5.1) for general values of DayT and N.
The formulate wokrs because day of the week repeats from Mon - Sunday 
We can map the day of the week in numbers from 0 - 6
The starting point is day T, plus how many N days after that
Module 7 ensures we stay within the 7 day cycle and correctly pick any day after n days


13. on a monday a friend says he will meet you again in 30 days.
What day of the week will that be?
Monday (DayT) = 0
DayN = 30
30 + 0 mod 7 = 2
Therefore the day of the week is Wednesday

14. If today is tuesday, how what day of the week will it be 1000 days from today?
DayT = 1 (Tuesday)
DayN = 1000
1000 + 1 mod 7
= 1001 mod7 = 0 (Monday)
